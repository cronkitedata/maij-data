This is the poorly named website for my data journalism course at [Arizona State University’s Cronkite School](https://cronkite.asu.edu). It focuses on documents and data reporting in investigations.

I began teaching in Arizona in 2018 as the Knight Chair in Journalism. This is my second tour as a Knight chair – the first was at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, from 2009 to 2012.

I’ve been a reporter and editor for most of my career, starting out as a beat reporter in Florida covering health care, workplace issues and the local economy. That beat led me to hang out a lot in federal bankruptcy and  civil courthouses, where many juicy stories seemed to land.  I began specializing in data reporting when I found that officials didn’t examine their own data and often had no idea what was in their files. 

From there, I went to The Washington Post, where I received most major national investigative journalism awards. They include the [Pulitzer Prize in Investigative Reporting](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/sari-horwitz-scott-higham-and-sarah-cohen), the Robert F. Kennedy award for public service, the Investigative Reporters and Editors medal, and the [Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting](https://shorensteincenter.org/investigative-reporting-prize/previous-winners-finalists/). Before I joined Cronkite I led the data reporting team at The New York Times that focused on investigative and enterprise stories. My team’s members were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize twice in my five years there, and contributed to another Pulitzer.

I was an elected board member for the 5,000-member [Investigative Reporters and Editors](https://ire.org) for eight years, two of them as president. Currently I serve on the boards of the [Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting](https://azcir.org) and the [Investigative Post](https://investigativepost.org] in Buffalo. Some of my favorite journalism volunteer work involves helping select newsrooms and reporters for Report for America and working as a mentor for IRE journalist of color and the  [Fund for Investigative Journalism](https://fij.org) grantees. I sometimes work on contract with news organizations for reporting, editing, and mentoring --  I consulted on a recent project that was just accepted for the Sundance Film Festival!
