    "text": "This is the poorly named website for my data journalism course at Arizona State University’s Cronkite School. It focuses on documents and data reporting in investigations.\nI began teaching in Arizona in 2018 as the Knight Chair in Journalism. This is my second tour as a Knight chair – the first was at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, from 2009 to 2012.\nI’ve been a reporter and editor for most of my career, starting out as a beat reporter in Florida covering health care, workplace issues and the local economy. That beat led me to hang out a lot in federal bankruptcy and civil courthouses, where many juicy stories seemed to land. I began specializing in data reporting when I found that officials didn’t examine their own data and often had no idea what was in their files.\nFrom there, I went to The Washington Post, where I received most major national investigative journalism awards. They include the Pulitzer Prize in Investigative Reporting, the Robert F. Kennedy award for public service, the Investigative Reporters and Editors medal, and the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting. Before I joined Cronkite I led the data reporting team at The New York Times that focused on investigative and enterprise stories. My team’s members were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize twice in my five years there, and contributed to another Pulitzer.\nI was an elected board member for the 5,000-member Investigative Reporters and Editors for eight years, two of them as president. Currently I serve on the boards of the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting and the [Investigative Post](https://investigativepost.org] in Buffalo. Some of my favorite journalism volunteer work involves helping select newsrooms and reporters for Report for America and working as a mentor for IRE journalist of color and the Fund for Investigative Journalism grantees. I sometimes work on contract with news organizations for reporting, editing, and mentoring – I consulted on a recent project that was just accepted for the Sundance Film Festival!\n— Sarah Cohen    December 2022   sarah.h.cohen@asu.edu"

    "text": "Last year, The Verge sent a shiver through the spines of professors everywhere with the piece called “File Not Found”, which chronicled the way Zoomers grew up using computers — with search. Historically, anyone who used a computer had to understand how they were organized and how to use folders. But powerful search engines both in the cloud and on your computer made that unnecessary. With that change came a huge roadblock to learning how to code – creating and navigating to a folder became an unfamiliar concept.\nComputer programs are dumb. They don’t have search – all they see are file names, prefaced by the names of the folders that contain them.\nOn a Mac, everything begins in your “home” directory – the folder that contains all of the things specific to you when you open up the computer. When we use R, RStudio and Github, it will become crucial that you understand how the computer sees your files, and how you can find them yourself.\nHere are two introductory videos about folder and files:\n\nWindows\nMacs\n\nKey points:\n\nSet up folders in your documents folder for our class — if we put everything in the same place called the same thing, you’ll always be able to follow along with tutorials and in class.\nHow to rename files on a Mac and on Windows. This will be useful when you download.\nMoving vs. copying files across folders\nBacking up your work\nStyle guide for naming conventions: “How to Name Files” from Jenny Bryant\n\n\n\n\n\nxkcd"

    "text": "Description\nThis is a class in data journalism focused the systematic use of public records, documents and other material in public affairs reporting. Previous generations might have called it “computer-assisted reporting” or “precision journalism”. Whatever the name, the idea is the same: original reporting and analysis in the service of stories, particularly in the accountability and explanatory genres.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Wormhoudt via Unsplash\n\n\n\nAnalyzing records can help you confirm or disprove a tip, isolate anecdotes, and explore stories or patterns that no one has thought to mention. When you use data-driven techniques, your street reporting will become deeper and more enlightening. Better yet, the techniques you’ll learn in this class will often yield exclusive stories.\nBy the end of this semester, you will be able to:\n\nIdentify how and when analysis of electronic records might strengthen your story, provide important insights, or suggest new lines of reporting.\nApply tools such as Excel and the R programming language for reporting in efficient, effective and ethical ways that avoid errors.\nIntegrate data journalism techniques with traditional reporting methods.\nWrite effectively with and about data, whether for text or for the ear.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis is a required course for the Masters’ of Arts in Investiative Journalism at Cronkite. It is tightly coordinated with the rest of the curriculum, and depends on your having mastered the work done in Boot Camp in the fall semester. If you have not done this, you’ll need to review on your own:\n\nNumeracy for journalism. There is some self-help material on Canvas if you want to review it.\nSpreadsheet basics: Simple calculations, sorting, filtering and pivot tables. We’ll review this for one week, but you are expected to have completed the assignment from fall and reviewed the results of that assignment.\nEthics in journalism: You should have a basic background on journalistic ethics, at least as practiced in the United States.\n\nThere is NO expectation that you have acquired or used data for your stories in the past, or that you have ever tried to write any computer code in any language."

Please contact me if you’re not sure if your operating system needs updating. A tablet or Chrome book just won’t work, and I can’t help you if you try to use them.1\nA regular mouse is strongly recommended. A basic wired mouse that connects to your USB port costs about $10 on Amazon.\n\nBooks and software\nYou do not need to buy any books or software. This site contains or links to all of the reading, viewing, and texts you need. We are using a bespoke online textbook I made that puts together and updates a lot of handouts and tutorials I’ve had scattered around various Canvas sites, Google Drive docs and Github repos. It’s a work in progress that will be updated throughout the semester.\nThe following free software will be used extensively in this class.\n\nThe Slack app (available in Apple app stores, Android stores and Windows store). When possible, use the app rather than the version in your browser. The browser lacks some of the functions that are in the app.\nA free copy of Microsoft Excel available in https://myapps.asu.edu . We’re only going to use Excel for about a week, so you might just want to use the ones in Cronkite labs. (Don’t use the Office 365 online version.)\nR and RStudio, both free community versions. You don’t need to install them yet. We’re going to do that together.\n\nWe’ll discuss any other software such as OpenRefine for data cleaning and Tabula for dealing with PDFs.\n\nRecommended\nBeginning on Jan. 23, you will have access to all of the lessons in Datacamp, an online training academy that usually costs $25/month. You’ll have free access to it for six months, after which you would have to pay to keep going. I’ll distribute a link to let you sign up as soon as it’s activated. 2\nBooks you already have\nThe Art of Access: Strategies for Acquiring Public Records, David Cullier and Charles N. Davis, 2nd edition (2018).\nInvestigative Reporters’ Handbook: A Guide to Documents, Databases, and Techniques, 6th Edition , by Brant Houston and Mark Horvit, 2021. Available for rent or purchase from MacMillan Learning.\nOther data journalism texts\nThese generally use SQL (Structured Query Language) rather than R for more advanced data work, but the concepts are really good:\n\nData for journalists: A practical guide ($$$), Brant Houston: The GOAT of data journalism texts, goes through a lot of the basics in a way that focuses on story rather than presentation.\nData plus journalism ($$$), Mike Reilley and Samantha Sunne. Both of these authors take a kitchen-sink approach to data and journalism, and the book is sort of the same, but it has good exercises and a laundry list of resources in each chapter. Its organization is a bit muddled.\nThe data journalism handbook 2” (Free), European Journalism Centre and Google News Initiative. This free book is a thoughtful collection of essays about the international movement.\n\nI’ll provide other resources for learning R for journalism when we get to that part of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional: A free Github account and Github Desktop app\n\n\n\nMany data journalists use https://github.com to share and collaborate on data journalism work. If a job requires significant data work, most employers will consider a candidate’s Github account in the same way they look their social media presence. You have the option of setting up a Github repository for this class and using it to submit your assignments. Please message me on Slack if you want to try that."

    "section": "Grading",
    "text": "Grading\nThe class uses a point system that initially adds up to 1,000 points for the semester.\n\n\nDaily work: 400\n\n\n\nClass preparation and labs: 300\n\n\n“What would you do?” posts and discussions : 100\n\n\n\nGraded homework: 200\n\n\nProjects : 400\n\n\nData replication project: 175\n\n\nFinal story memo : 225\n\n\n\nAll work will be submitted and feedback reviewed through Canvas based on the due date shown there in Mountain Standard Time.\n\nY grade option\nYou have the option of a Y grade this semester, which signifies “satisfactory” completion of the course and is considered to be the equivalent of a C or above. This grade lets you earn course credit but is not factored into your GPA. If you opt for a Y grade and do not achieve a “satisfactory” level (70 percent or above), you will receive a D or an E, depending on their grades on assignments during the course. Email me at sarah.h.cohen@asu.edu informing me that you have elected the Y grade option by January 15. You cannot change your mind after the drop/add period.\n\n\nDaily work\n400 points\n\nLabs, pre-labs and class preparation\nDoing well in this class means working slowly, methodically and consistently throughout the semester.\n\n\n\nNearly half of your grade is dependent on this slow and steady work.\nMany weeks, there will be one or two low-stakes assignments. Sometimes, I’ll ask you to reflect on what you did and provide feedback. Other times, you will show that you went through a tutorial on your own. It also includes labs that we do in class. I plan on many “prelabs”, which force you to slow down as you review tutorials and reading on your own and help me diagnose where things are muddy. Labs are done in class, usually on Wednesdays.\n\n(NB: Initially the pre-labs are 10 points and the labs are 25, but that could change as we gain experience using this system, which is new this semester.)\n\n\n\nWhat would you do?\nYou’ve had some background in journalism ethics, but there are specific issues that come up surrounding acquiring, analyzing and presenting data. You will be presented with four scenarios that are based on real-world situations. After reading the material, you will be asked to reflect on some specific questions on a discussion board, which will form the basis of our in-class discussion. Each of these is worth 25 points.\n\n\n\nReplication project\n175 points\nThere are three separate assignments for this project, which challenges you to reproduce some sentences published in real stories using the same data used by the reporters. I’ll provide the stories and the data. Your first job is to identify paragraphs in the story that depended on the dataset that you’ve been given. The second gives you a chance to turn in a draft of your work so that I can help you. The last one is the final version.\n\n\nStory memo\n225 points\nIn this project, you’ll develop a story pitch using a combination of story backgrounding and data analysis. I’ll give you a choice of at least three datatsets that I know will work for this assignment. You may propose your own, but it must be easy to obtain, relatively clean, and complicated or large enough that there is something for you to analyze beyond a basic statistic. Generally, the dataset will be of individual records (accidents, inspections, deaths or events), not statistical compilations. You’ll understand this better as we move along.\nThe specific list of datasets may be coordinated with your investigative reporting class, News21 and/or the Howard Center, so they’re subject to change.\nAlthough this is one-fifth of your grade, it’s split among four assignments over more than a month. You’ll build the memo a little at a time, so by the end, it won’t seem like a big lift. I promise.\n\n\nGraded homework\n200 points\nThere will be four smaller graded assignments that are more important than daily work but don’t rise to the level of a project. They are shown in Canvas each with 50 points.\n\n\nGrading policies\n\n50 points or more\n\n\nAny assignment worth 50 points or more will be graded with letters, ranging from E to A+. It follows ASU’s policy on grades. In following Cronkite policies, they will not be rounded up.\n\n\nASU’s policy is:\n\n“A” is reserved for “excellent” or “outstanding” work, which goes beyond the explicit requirements in quality, depth, effort, or presentation.\n“B” means “successful”. That means it’s on time, accurate, written or presented in a professional way, and answers the requirements of the assignment.\n“C” is considered “Acceptable” work, in that it has met some, but not all, of the requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder 50 points\nSmaller assignments and labs will be graded as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n115%\nI will award extra points when the work shows extraordinary effort, thought and engagement. You can do everything right, receive an A+ in the course, and never see this. Instead, it’s a way for me to acknowledge unusually ambitious work that goes well beyond the original assignment.\n\n\n100%\nYou have completed all of the work assigned at an acceptable level of quality, and submitted it according to the instructions by the deadline. This might include running code, writing code, providing questions or feedback, or summarizing your results as a journalist. The work shows no fundamental factual errors and reflects an attempt to apply the material at hand. Sometimes, you’ll end up explaining in your homework what you tried to accomplish but couldn’t quite succeed — that’s ok! I hope all of your assignments can acheive this level but understand that it’s not always possible.\n\n\n50%\nYou turned in a late or partial assignment or one that shows cursory review of the material. I hope these will be rare, but I expect most people will have one or two of these throughout the semester.\n\n\n0%\nYou didn’t turn anything in, or what was turned had no meaningful work done."

Please refrain from eating, napping, using social media, shopping, or working on something else. I expect you to treat your colleagues with respect and be polite to any guests. (I understand this class is over a lunchtime, but there is no eating allowed in the labs. I’ll be enforcing that.)\nI will insist that devices are closed and turned off for guests, but it’s disprespectful to the entire class when you decide to do something else during discussions or presentations. In addition, research shows that you are much worse at multi-tasking than you think you are, and the class won’t stop because you got distracted or sidetracked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure\n\n\n\nI have a great deal of difficulty concentrating when someone is attending to something else, including lunch or lost sleep, during class. I know this is a character flaw. I will try to overcome it, but if I start losing my place or stumbling over simple questions, I may ask you to leave the classroom until you are ready to engage with the material we’re working on.\n\n\nI generally will not monitor messages in Slack, Zoom, or email during or just before class time. The only reliable way to get me a message between 10:20a and 1:20p Mondays and Wednesdays is to do so in person in the classroom.\n\nAttendance and deadlines\nThere are no excused absences in this course, except for true medical or other emergencies or religious observances. You might decide it’s more important to schedule a job interview, attend a family event, interview a source, or schedule a tight connection on a flight than to attend class or complete your work. If I were you, I might decide the same thing, but these are choices that reflect your priorities. They’re not emergencies, nor are they excused absences or deadlines.\nAs in all journalism work, you are expected to meet deadlines. Late assignments will be heavily penalized and those with small point counts may not be accepted at all.\nPlease advise me the first week of class of any ASU-endorsed absences such as a religious holiday or participation in an ASU team sport that will cause you to miss class so that I can plan accommodations. Here’s what to do if you want an accommodation for an emergency:\n\nIf you suspect you have COVID, or if you believe you have been exposed and should quarantine, you should contact the dean of students for instructions about what to do next. I can get verification for your absence from them.\nIf there is an emergency, such as a car accident or a death in your close circle or family, please let me know as soon as possible and we’ll work out what to do next.\nWe all know there is a lot of flu and RSV going around this year. If you are sick, you should contact ASU Health Services or your doctor. They can provide the documentation if you are too ill or contagious to leave home.\n\nIn these circumstances, I will work with you to accommodate the absence. That might include extending deadlines and helping you find assistance such as ASU mental health resources and tutoring. I may be able to let you observe (without participating) via Zoom, but you shouldn’t count on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay I be excused?\n\n\n\nThe short answer is “yes” – I don’t take attendance and there is no class participation grade. I get it — sometimes you don’t feel 100% or you have something more important to do or the bus broke down.\nHowever, it will be up to you to keep up or catch up. You will not be offered the opportunity to observe via Zoom. Deadlines will not be extended. You’ll also be excluded from any group assignments that might be part of the class that day.\n\n\nThat said, give yourself a break. You may get an extension on daily work twice during the semester without any penalty. This includes labs/prelabs and graded homework. You don’t need to give me a reason – just let me know by 10am the day of class, or 6pm the night before the deadline, and I’ll give you an automatic 48-hour extension. These extensions will not be granted for any part of the two large projects.\n\n\nAccuracy\nIf you pursue reporting with data-driven techniques, you’ll often create original information that no one else can confirm. In fact, your sources are often happy to explain a result you present to them, even if it’s entirely wrong. This puts an even bigger burden on you to understand your sources, to question your assumptions and find holes in your work. If an answer seems too newsworthy, walk through everything you’ve done step by step. Seek out errors; ask experts or colleagues to challenge your results. We’ll spend a lot of time on practices that will help protect you from errors but your own skepticism (and sometimes even fear) is the best defense.\nI don’t expect your work to be polished and exact. However, work that shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the source, contains a severe miscalculation or misinterpretation, or ignores clear warning signs will receive an E. This is the equivalent of having to retract an entire story because it was based on an obvious error.\nThis requires you to gut-check all of your data work before you turn it in or include it in a sentence. Actually look at your results and decide “could this possibly be true?”\n\n\nHaving trouble?\n\n\n\n\nBy Fabian Moller via Unsplash\n\n\nLearning data skills requires a lot of trial and error – a LOT of error. It’s frustrating and maddening at times and you won’t be alone. But there are some strategies that you can use to help get you past roadblocks.\n\nSlow down! Unlike the rest of journalism, going faster doesn’t help. Separate the problem into pieces and solve it one step at a time.\nIf you’ve been working on something for more than 20 minutes without making any progress, don’t waste more time on it. If you’re making just a little progress, keep going. But take a break and come back to it if you’re stuck. Get help if you’re really stuck.\nRemember the goal: We’re not trying to become social scientists, computer programmers or data analysts. We’re journalists. Simplify your questions, focusing on newsworthiness rather than academic research.\nPractice. Look for opportunities to hone your skills by applying them outside of class on a personal project or for a story or another course.

    "text": "Cronkite school policies\n\nCollaborations\nAll work submitted under your name must be your work and your work alone. When you are assigned work in teams, contributors should be credited when an individual was primarily responsible for a portion of the work. For example, if one student takes the lead on analyzing data and another on writing the results, you should give credit where it is due.\nI will encourage you to work in pairs during some of the labs — it’s much easier to solve problems when two people are looking at the same thing. But you must turn in your work separately and answer question prompts on your own.\n\n\nExtra Credit\nSimple. There is none. Why? This course is made up of a lot of little pieces. They can’t be replaced by attending a lecture.\n\n\nCronkite School Diversity Principles\nThe Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication embraces inclusivity in student, staff and faculty populations in order to create an academic environment that fosters diversity of thought and acceptance of all people regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or societal, political, cultural, economic, spiritual, or physical differences. To this end, the school directs efforts to the following four principles:\n\nActively seek out and encourage diverse populations to become productive members of the faculty, staff and the student body;\nCreate and maintain a work, learning and social environment that is cognizant and supportive of a diversity of human differences and beliefs;\nIncorporate within the formal content of the curriculum and in each course an affirmation of the core journalistic values of accuracy, fairness, ethical behavior and sensitivity when reflecting an increasingly multicultural world;\nFoster and support a climate in which events and activities of the school reflect diversity of awareness, sensitivity to and support for people of different origins, orientations and abilities.\n\n\n\nStudent Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services (SAILS)\nStudent Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services facilitates accommodations for students who have registered with that office. Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case, course-by-course basis through an interactive process with people who can best support student success. Prior to receiving accommodations from their instructor, students must receive verification of eligibility by registering with SAILS. Student SAILS information is confidential.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe school has zero tolerance for academic dishonesty; instructors enforce academic integrity in every course and educational activity offered or sanctioned by the school. Any allegation of academic dishonesty will be referred to an appointed academic integrity officer for investigation. They elevate cases to the school’s standards committee for review and recommendation to the dean of the school. If the committee finds that a student has engaged in academic dishonesty in any form — including but not limited to cheating, plagiarizing, and fabricating — that student shall receive a grade of XE for the class and may face suspension or expulsion from ASU.\nYou must complete the Academic Integrity pledge within the first week of class, included in Canvas as a quiz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia Unsplash"

    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\nQ: I don’t have any experience. What do I need to succeed?\nEveryone in this class has gone through the boot camp required of all masters students. We covered numeracy and spreadsheet basics in that class, and those modules are prerequisites for this one. No other coding or data analysis background is expected.\nQ: This looks like a lot of work. How long do I have to spend on it every week?\nI try to follow the ASU standard for a 3-credit course — approximately 9 hours per week, including class and lab time. That suggests that, on average, you should expect to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week outside of class on preparation, homework and projects. The time commitment is a little front-loaded as we race to get you the skills you need later in the semester.\nIf you’re spending considerably more time on assigned work and preparation, please let me know – that’s not the intention.\nQ: How should I communicate with you?\nSlack or in person is best. All assignments must be turned in via Canvas assignments unless I direct you elsewhere. Do NOT email assignments.\nQ: How will I know how I’m doing?\nPay attention to the feedback on your routine homework and labs. I’ll give you a sense of where you’re excelling and where you might improve. I’m always happy to meet and discuss strategies that will help you get to the next level in your journalism or your data analysis skills.\nI’ve found that Canvas isn’t very accurate in estimating the final grade as we work through the semester, so I’ve turned that feature off. It will just mislead you.\nQ: How do I ask good questions?\nIn technical work, asking a good question is an art. Try to:\n\nDescribe what you are trying to do – what does success look like? What question are you trying to answer?\nProvide a snippet of the code or the Excel formula that you’re trying\nTake a screen shot or quote the error message if there is one\n\nQ: I already know how to code and analyze data. Why do I have to take this class?\nEven if you know how to code, I presume you are at Cronkite because you want to apply all of your skills to a journalism career. You probably knew how to use a phone or take a picture before you came to j-school, but you may not have used them the way you do now. That said, talk with me if you’re concerned that you won’t be challenged enough or want to go further. We’ll find ways to make the time productive and take you to the next level in data reporting.\nQ: Can I use ChatGPT to help me with my coding?\nSure — for help, not for answers. In fact, one of the things it’s really good at is answering the question, “Why doesn’t this code work?” You will have to determine if its answer is right and if it uses the functions and code you’re responsible for mastering. But for this purpose it’s pretty similar to searching Google and Substack or asking colleague for help. It might do a little better than the alternatives."

And you’ll probably have to start paying before too long.\n\n\n\n\nSet up your course folders / hard drive\nDO NOT expect to use Google drive to store your work – it won’t work. You will not be able to directly access the data in the Google drive on your computer, and there are strict limits on the size of the data file you can transfer using it. Believe me. We’ve tried.

    "text": "Preparation\nThis prep might leave you feeling bewildered. Don’t let it get to you. You will get used to the look and feel of the software and some of the technical language soon. You don’t have to internalize all of this. Instead, try to get used to the screen and the process of typing the commands into the computer. You’ll probably get a lot of errors, and that’s fine — they’re not judging you. They’re supposed to be hints, even when they’re red and use words that look like $#u893q#r32.\n\nReview the textbook chapter, “Getting started with R and RStudio”\n\nMake sure to install the packages at the beginning of the chapter. (We might have been able to get this part done in class already – we’ll see how it goes.) You might want to get it going and then get a cup of tea – it will take at least a few minutes once it starts and could take longer. It might look like it’s stalled. If you have trouble at this point, please post a question to #dj-sos Slack channel and describe what’s happening.\nTry the “Programming basics” tutorial linked in that chapter. Don’t worry about all of the math in it; you don’t have to go through the part where you answer questions. Instead, just focus on the concepts of the 1-minute videos: functions, arguments, objects and data types.1\nWatch Andrew Heiss’s RStudio tour. Again, don’t worry much about how math-centric it is. Our work will be much less so. But he does a good job of going through the most confusing pieces of what’s in front of you.\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 2 hours on this. You might finish sooner, but you’ll need this to move forward so don’t rush. I also expect you’ll have questions when we get to class.\nOPTIONAL: If you are nervous, consider reviewing the Using Quarto chapter that we’ll be following in our class lab today."
