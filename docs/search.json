I can’t post it here. Please review the following sections:\n\nIntroduction\nChapter 1: What’s a number?\nChapter 2: You don’t have to read this carefully, but you need to know where to find it: “Fractions and Percents” (p11); Measuring Change (p 26-28) and Understanding Averages (44-47).\nChapter 6: The 10 Most wanted errors made by reporters.\n\n“How to prevent confirmation bias affecting your journalism” Paul Bradshaw, Online Journalism Blog. This is a particularly big problem in data journalism, since we seek out stories in databases based on tips or broad ideas, and can often find them.\nJust the video BBC Worklife, How ‘survivorship bias’ can cause you to make mistakes\n“Regression to the mean, by James Lawther, SquawkPoint. Look at this (describing the past) in the context of the Chapter 6 above, where it discusses the Gambler’s Fallacy (predicting the future). They’re pretty much the same.\nProcrastination.com’s “The greatest problem of today’s world: Dunning-Kruger effect”, by Adela Schicker. The video is geared toward political arguments, but please try to think of it in terms of your reporting. How might this affect how you go about reporting on a complex problem?\nTwo videos from the Knight Center for the Americas on “Equity and Ethics in Data Journalism’s” module 3 (links below). I’m not thrilled with the pace or specific content with these videos, but they’re the best single spot I’ve found for these common problems. (She talks about writing data journalism stories, but she’s never been a journalist of any kind. Sigh.)\n\nCommon mistakes in data analysis\nProsecutor’s Fallacy in data journalism OR this piece on prosecutor’s fallacy by Ray Johns, 2019. The video is very confusing because the bars aren’t proportional – you get a very weird picture of the data trying to decipher the graphics. It’s similar to the “flipped probabilities” and cancer clusters described in the IRE beat book Chapter 6.\n\nOptional, also by Bradshaw: “A journalist’s guide to cognitive bias (and how to avoid it)” for other kinds of biases that we might bring to our reporting. These include common problems in newsrooms, such as a “sunk-cost” bias or a negativity bias."

    "text": "This is the poorly named website for my data journalism course at Arizona State University’s Cronkite School. It focuses on documents and data reporting in investigations.\nI began teaching in Arizona in 2018 as the Knight Chair in Journalism. This is my second tour as a Knight chair – the first was at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, from 2009 to 2012.\nI’ve been a reporter and editor for most of my career, starting out as a beat reporter in Florida covering health care, workplace issues and the local economy. That beat led me to hang out a lot in federal bankruptcy and civil courthouses, where many juicy stories seemed to land. I began specializing in data reporting when I found that officials didn’t examine their own data and often had no idea what was in their files.\nFrom there, I went to The Washington Post, where I received most major national investigative journalism awards. They include the Pulitzer Prize in Investigative Reporting, the Robert F. Kennedy award for public service, the Investigative Reporters and Editors medal, and the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting. Before I joined Cronkite I led the data reporting team at The New York Times that focused on investigative and enterprise stories. My team’s members were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize twice in my five years there, and contributed to another Pulitzer.\nI was an elected board member for the 5,000-member Investigative Reporters and Editors for eight years, two of them as president. Currently I serve on the boards of the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting and the [Investigative Post](https://investigativepost.org] in Buffalo. Some of my favorite journalism volunteer work involves helping select newsrooms and reporters for Report for America and working as a mentor for IRE journalist of color and the Fund for Investigative Journalism grantees. I sometimes work on contract with news organizations for reporting, editing, and mentoring – I consulted on a recent project that was just accepted for the Sundance Film Festival!\n— Sarah Cohen    December 2022   sarah.h.cohen@asu.edu"

    "text": "Description\nThis is a class in data journalism focused the systematic use of public records, documents and other material in public affairs reporting. Previous generations might have called it “computer-assisted reporting” or “precision journalism”. Whatever the name, the idea is the same: original reporting and analysis in the service of stories, particularly in the accountability and explanatory genres.\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Wormhoudt via Unsplash\n\n\nAnalyzing records can help you confirm or disprove a tip, isolate anecdotes, and explore stories or patterns that no one has thought to mention. When you use data-driven techniques, your street reporting will become deeper and more enlightening. Better yet, the techniques you’ll learn in this class will often yield exclusive stories.\nBy the end of this semester, you will be able to:\n\nIdentify how and when analysis of electronic records might strengthen your story, provide important insights, or suggest new lines of reporting.\nApply the R programming language for reporting in efficient, effective and ethical ways that avoid errors.\nIntegrate data journalism techniques with traditional reporting methods.\nWrite effectively with and about data, whether for text or for the ear.\n\nYou’ll have a new super power for your journalism.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis is a required course for the Masters’ of Arts in Investiative Journalism at Cronkite. It is tightly coordinated with the rest of the curriculum, and depends on your having mastered the work done in Boot Camp in the fall semester. If you have not done this, you’ll need to review on your own:\n\nSpreadsheet basics: Simple calculations, sorting, filtering and pivot tables. There are videos and exercises in the MAIJ textbook in case you need a refresher.\nEthics Standard journalistic ethics as practiced in the United States.\nBasic numeracy: As graduate students, we expect you to come to school with basic numeracy skills such as computing percents or averages. There are materials provided to you if you need refreshers.\n\nYou are not expected to have acquired or used data for your stories in the past, or to have ever tried to write any computer code in any language."

    "section": "Grading",
    "text": "Grading\nThe class uses a point system that initially adds up to 1,000 points for the semester. It’s possible this number of total points may fall if we find there are just too many assignments. If so, I’ll provide an optional assignment during the exam period to make up the difference.\n\n\nDaily work: 400\n\nThe final point count may be a little higher than this.\n\n\nClass preparation and labs: 300\n\n\n“What would you do?” posts and discussions : 100\n\n\n\nGraded homework: 200 150\n\n\nProjects : 400\n\n\nData replication project: 175\n\n\nFinal story memo : 225\n\n\n\nAll work will be submitted and feedback reviewed through Canvas based on the due date shown there in Mountain Standard Time.\n\nDaily work\n400 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1 update\n\n\n\nThe points aren’t quite adding up to the 1,000 planned at the beginning of class, making each assignment worth a little more toward your final grade than I’d intended. To make up for this, there is an optional assignment due at the time of our final exam period. You may skip it and keep the grade as it comes out with fewer points, or you may complete it so that the previous assignments keep their relative importance.\n\n\n\nLabs, walkthroughs and class preparation\nDoing well in this class means working slowly, methodically and consistently throughout the semester.\nNearly half of your grade is dependent on this slow and steady work.\n\n\n\nThere will be at least one low-stakes assignment nearly every week. Sometimes, I’ll ask you to reflect on what you did and provide feedback. Other times, you will show that you went through a tutorial on your own. We’ll do a lot of labs in class.\nWalkthroughs are exercises intended to force you to slow down and go through a tutorial, sometimes on your own and sometimes in class. I’ll ask you to provide feedback on areas that are muddy or difficult, which I’ll use to help focus our work. These are usually worth 10 points each. Labs are exercises for you to practice and apply what you’ve learned. These are initially worth 25 points each, which might be adjusted later in the semeseter.\nThese will be submitted in Canvas assignments, but I haven’t yet produced all of them; total points in Canvas won’t be correct until partway through the semester.\n\n\nWhat would you do?\nYou’ve had some background in journalism ethics, but there are specific issues that come up surrounding acquiring, analyzing and presenting data. You will be presented with four scenarios that are based on real-world situations. After reading the material, you will be asked to reflect on some specific questions on a discussion board, which will form the basis of our in-class discussion. Each of these is worth 25 points.\n\n\n\nGraded homework\n150 points\nThere will be four three smaller graded assignments that are more important than daily work but don’t rise to the level of a project. Each is worth 50 points. An optional assignment worth 50 points will be due instead of a final exam.\n\n\nReplication project\n175 points\nThere are three separate assignments for this project, which challenges you to reproduce some sentences published in real stories using the same data used by the reporters. I’ll provide the stories and the data.\n\n\nStory memo\n225 points\nYou’ll develop a story pitch using a combination of story backgrounding and data analysis. I’ll give you a choice of at two datasets that I know will work for this assignment. You may propose your own, but it must be easy to obtain, relatively clean, and complicated or large enough that there is something for you to analyze beyond a basic statistic. Generally, the dataset will be of individual records (accidents, inspections, deaths or events), not statistical compilations. You’ll understand this better as we move along.\nThe specific list of datasets could be coordinated with your investigative reporting class, News21 and/or the Howard Center, so they’re subject to change.\nAlthough this is one-quarter of your grade, it’s split among four assignments over more than a month. You’ll build the memo a little at a time, so by the end, it won’t seem like a big lift. I promise.\n\n\nGrading policies\nFollowing Cronkite policies, letter grades will not be rounded up. I reserve the right to add extra points to a grade if the assignment shows extraordinary effort, thought, engagement or ambition. This will be rare — it never happened in some of the past semesters.\n\n50 points or more\n\n\nAny assignment worth 50 points or more will be graded with letters, ranging from E to A+. It follows ASU’s policy on grades.\n\n\nASU’s policy is:\n\n“A” is reserved for “excellent” or “outstanding” work, which goes beyond the explicit requirements in quality, depth, effort, or presentation.\n“B” means “successful”. That means it’s on time, accurate, written or presented in a professional way, and answers the requirements of the assignment.\n“C” is considered “Acceptable” work, in that it has met some, but not all, of the requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder 50 points\nSmaller assignments and labs will be graded as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n100%\nYou completed all of the work assigned at an acceptable level of quality, and submitted it according to the instructions by the deadline. This might include running code, writing code, providing questions or feedback, or summarizing your results as a journalist. The work shows no fundamental factual errors and reflects an attempt to apply the material at hand. Sometimes, you’ll end up explaining in your homework what you tried to accomplish but couldn’t quite succeed — that’s ok! I hope all of your assignments can acheive this level but understand that it’s not always possible.\n\n\n50%\nYou turned in a late or partial assignment or one that shows cursory review of the material. I hope these will be rare, but I expect most people will have one or two of these throughout the semester.\n\n\n0%\nYou didn’t turn anything in, or what was turned had no meaningful work done."

    "text": "Course requirements\n\n\nShowing up is 80 percent of life.\n\n Woody Allen \n\nThis is an immersion, in-person class and is not offered via Zoom.\nThe minimal requirement is to arrive on time, prepared, and ready to work.\nPlease refrain from eating, napping, using social media, shopping, catching up on messages, or working on something else. I expect you to treat your colleagues with respect and be polite to any guests. Devices must be closed and turned off for guests and used only for class work the rest of the time. Research shows that you are much worse at multi-tasking than you think you are, and the class won’t stop because you got sidetracked. I get it that this class is at lunch time, but the labs are strict no-eating zones. Please step outside the class when you want to eat or when you’re tempted to multitask.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp me!\n\n\n\nI am easily distracted. I can’t stop staring at someone who nods off, is looking at their phone, or is eating lunch.\nI know this is a character flaw. I will try to overcome it, but if I start losing my place or stumbling over simple questions, I may ask you to leave the classroom or close your computer until you are ready to engage with the material we’re working on. If that happens, I’m not calling you out or chiding you. I really am just trying to maintain my own concentration.\n\n\nI will not monitor messages in Slack or email during class. The only reliable way to get me a message between 11:30a and 1:20p Mondays and Wednesdays is to do so in person in the classroom. If you need to reach me between those hours, please ask a classmate to get my attention.\n\nAttendance and deadlines\nThere are no excused absences in this course, except for true medical or other emergencies or religious observances.\nYou might decide it’s more important to go to a job interview, attend a family event, interview a source, or schedule a tight connection on a flight than to attend class or complete your work. If I were you, I might decide the same thing, but these are choices that reflect your priorities. They’re not emergencies, nor are they excused absences.\nAs in all journalism work, you are expected to meet deadlines. Late assignments will be heavily penalized and those with small point counts may not be accepted at all.\nThat said, give yourself a break. There are two no-questions-asked 48-hour extensions on daily work during the semester. This includes only the labs/walkthroughs and graded homework, not any part of the projects or “What would you do?” assignments. You don’t need a reason; just let me know before the lab or deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it ok if I miss class today?\n\n\n\nThe short answer is “yes” — you alone decide how to spend your time. I don’t take attendance and there is no class participation grade. I get it. Sometimes you don’t feel 100% or you have something more important to do or you missed the bus.\nBut when you make that choice, you have to catch up on your own. I won’t go over what happened in class with you individually. You’ll receive a zero for any missed deadline. You’ll forgo verbal feedback on projects or assignments that were reviewed in class.\n\n\nPlease advise me the first week of class of any ASU-endorsed absences such as a religious holiday or participation in an ASU team sport that will cause you to miss class so that I can plan accommodations.\nHere’s what to do in the event of an emergency or illness:\n\nIf there is an emergency, such as a car accident or a death in your close circle or family, please let me know as soon as practical, and we’ll work out what to do next. Under these circumstances, the last thing you need to worry about is making a deadline. I can coordinate with the Dean of Students to reduce the number of calls you have to make.\nIf you are sick, you should contact ASU Health Services or your doctor. They can provide documentation if you are too ill or contagious to leave home.\n\nAccommodations in these circumstances can include extending deadlines, excusing a routine assignment and helping you find assistance such as ASU mental health resources and tutoring. I may be able to let you observe (without participating) via Zoom, but you shouldn’t count on it.\n\n\nAccuracy\nIf you pursue reporting with data-driven techniques, you’ll often create original information that no one else can confirm. In fact, your sources are often happy to explain a result you present to them, even if it’s entirely wrong. This puts an even bigger burden on you to understand your sources, to question your assumptions and find holes in your work. If an answer seems too newsworthy1, walk through everything you’ve done step by step. Seek out errors; ask experts or colleagues to challenge your results. We’ll spend a lot of time on practices that will help protect you from errors but your own skepticism (and sometimes even fear) is the best defense.\nI don’t expect your work to be polished and exact. However, work that shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the source, contains a severe miscalculation or misinterpretation, or ignores clear warning signs will receive an E. This is the equivalent of having to retract an entire story because it was based on an obvious error.\nThis requires you to gut-check all of your data work before you turn it in or include it in a sentence. Actually look at your results and decide “could this possibly be true?”\n\n\nHaving trouble?\n\n\n\n\nFabian Moller via Unsplash\n\n\n\nLearning data skills requires a lot of trial and error – a LOT of error. It’s frustrating and maddening at times and you won’t be alone. But there are some strategies that you can use to help get you past roadblocks.\n\nSlow down! Unlike the rest of journalism, going faster doesn’t help. Separate the problem into pieces and solve it one step at a time.\nDon’t get upset over errors. They don’t reflect some kind of flaw in your work – they’re supposed to be helpful. Try to read the error and decipher what’s wrong.\nExpect to go down unproductive roads at times. That’s also OK and even helpful. A story goes through many drafts before it’s finished, and the same thing will happen with your analysis and programming.\nIf you’ve been working on something for more than 20 minutes without making any progress, don’t waste more time on it. If you’re making just a little progress, keep going. But take a break and come back to it if you’re stuck. Get help if you’re really stuck. Your morale is a valuable commodity and we don’t want to squander it.\nRemember the goal: We’re not trying to become social scientists, computer programmers or data analysts. We’re journalists. Simplify your questions, focusing on newsworthiness rather than academic research.\nPractice. Look for opportunities to hone your skills by applying them outside of class on a personal project or for a story or another course. If you can’t think of any practice, try a #tidytuesday challenge."

    "text": "Cronkite school policies\n\nCollaborations\nAll work submitted under your name must be your work and your work alone. When you are assigned work in teams, contributors should be credited when an individual was primarily responsible for a portion of the work. For example, if one student takes the lead on analyzing data and another on writing the results, you should give credit where it is due.\nI will encourage you to work in pairs during some of the labs — it’s much easier to solve problems when two people are looking at the same thing. But you must turn in your work separately and answer question prompts on your own.\n\n\nExtra Credit\nSimple. There is none. Why? This course is made up of a lot of little pieces. They can’t be replaced by attending a lecture.\n\n\nCronkite School Diversity Principles\nThe Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication embraces inclusivity in student, staff and faculty populations in order to create an academic environment that fosters diversity of thought and acceptance of all people regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or societal, political, cultural, economic, spiritual, or physical differences. To this end, the school directs efforts to the following four principles:\n\nActively seek out and encourage diverse populations to become productive members of the faculty, staff and the student body;\nCreate and maintain a work, learning and social environment that is cognizant and supportive of a diversity of human differences and beliefs;\nIncorporate within the formal content of the curriculum and in each course an affirmation of the core journalistic values of accuracy, fairness, ethical behavior and sensitivity when reflecting an increasingly multicultural world;\nFoster and support a climate in which events and activities of the school reflect diversity of awareness, sensitivity to and support for people of different origins, orientations and abilities.\n\n\n\nStudent Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services (SAILS)\nStudent Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services facilitates accommodations for students who have registered with that office. Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case, course-by-course basis through an interactive process with people who can best support student success. Prior to receiving accommodations from their instructor, students must receive verification of eligibility by registering with SAILS. Student SAILS information is confidential.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe school has zero tolerance for academic dishonesty; instructors enforce academic integrity in every course and educational activity offered or sanctioned by the school. Any allegation of academic dishonesty will be referred to an appointed academic integrity officer for investigation. They elevate cases to the school’s standards committee for review and recommendation to the dean of the school. If the committee finds that a student has engaged in academic dishonesty in any form — including but not limited to cheating, plagiarizing, and fabricating — that student shall receive a grade of XE for the class and may face suspension or expulsion from ASU.\nYou must complete the Academic Integrity pledge within the first week of class, included in Canvas as a quiz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrodeur via Unsplash"

    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\nQ: I don’t have any experience. What do I need to succeed?\nEveryone in this class has gone through the boot camp required of all masters students. You covered spreadsheet basics and were expected to have basic numeracy skills such as computing percentages and averages. No other coding or data analysis background is expected.\nHere is a tip sheet made by Jordan Gerard from the 2023 MAIJ cohort to help set your expectations.\nQ: This looks like a lot of work. How long do I have to spend on it every week?\nI try to follow the ASU standard for a 3-credit course — approximately 9 hours per week, including class and lab time. That suggests that, on average, you should expect to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week outside of class on preparation, homework and projects.\nIf you’re spending considerably more time on assigned work and preparation, please let me know – that’s not the intention. If you’re spending considerably less time, evaluate whether you’re really engaging with the work rather than speeding through it.\nThat said, the work in this class is a little front-loaded as we race to get you some skills you can apply later on. You’ll find that you may spend more time before Spring Break, and less after it.\nQ: How should I communicate with you? A: Slack\nSlack or in person is best. All assignments must be turned in via Canvas assignments unless I direct you elsewhere. Do NOT email assignments.\nQ: How will I know how I’m doing?\nPay attention to the feedback on your routine homework and labs. I’ll give you a sense of where you’re excelling and where you might improve. I’m always happy to meet and discuss strategies that will help you get to the next level in your journalism or your data analysis skills.\nI’ve found that Canvas isn’t very accurate in estimating the final grade as we work through the semester, so I’ve turned that feature off. It will just mislead you. I’ll turn it back on towards the end of the semester when it’s more accurate.\nQ: How do I ask good questions?\nIn technical work, asking a good question is an art. Try to:\n\nDescribe what you are trying to do – what does success look like? What question are you trying to answer?\nProvide a snippet of the code or a screenshot of what you are trying. Include any context needed.\nTake a screen shot or quote the error message if there is one\n\nQ: I already know how to code and analyze data. Why do I have to take this class?\nEven if you know how to code, I presume you are at Cronkite because you want to apply all of your skills to a journalism career. You probably knew how to use a phone or a camera before you came to j-school, but you may not have used them the way you do now. Talk with me if you’re concerned that you won’t be challenged enough or want to go further. We’ll find ways to make the time productive and take you to the next level in data reporting.\nQ: Can I use AI like ChatGPT to help me with my coding?\nSure — for help, not for answers. In fact, one of the things it’s really good at is answering the question, “Why doesn’t this code work?” You will have to determine if its answer is right. But for this purpose it’s pretty similar to searching Google and Substack or asking colleague for help.\nYou are responsible for learning the methods taught in the class, not some other way to accomplish the same thing. You don’t have to memorize anything, but you should be able to recognize whether the code these tools suggest use methods you’ve seen before. We’re working toward mastering a little corner of the R and programming world, not sampling the whole universe.\nThe free version of ChatGPT, which used training data that ended in 2021, is a little too old for some of the things you’ll be learning. Consider trying Perplexity.ai or Github Copilot instead."

    "text": "Preparation\n\nLearn a new way to read\nToday’s lab is geared at learning how to read and view journalism as a writer and producer, by closely examining HOW a story was conceived and executed rather than whether you liked it or thought it was “good”. This reading gets you ready for the lab:\n\nTextbook:\n\nIntroduction to Reporting with data\nLearn a New Way to Read\n\n\n\nStory\n\nRural Aid goes to Urban Areas This is a pdf of a very old story from the Washington Post. I use it not because it’s great, but because it is reasonably short and remains one of the most straightforward examples of investigative data reporting that I know of. This is a classic example of using administrative records to find anecdotes and examples for stories, then aggregating them into broader statistical findings. Pay attention to the elements that make this story work – the data sources, examples used, use of experts to define classifications, and the public records mentioned. Make sure to read the methodology notes on the second page.\n\n\n\n\nTry to install R and RStudio\nYou’ll have to finish this by Friday, but try to get it done before class. That way I can help you if you run into trouble.\nComplete the installation tutorial in the textbook , including the videos linked at the top. You don’t have to answer the questions after the videos.\n\nIf you plan to use your own laptop or desktop:\n\nGet as far as you can with the installation\nTry starting up RStudio (not R).\nNote any error messages or other troubles you have so we can fix them in class. Don’t try to Google the resolution on this – the answers might create more problems than they fix. I’ll help you at the end of class.\n\n\n\nIf you are going to use something else:\n\nLabs in school: Make sure you know where you will use the software and have tried starting it. Please let me know if the lab is not set up as you might expect.\nPosit Cloud : Sign up for the service and make sure you know how to access it in class. It’s not the great alternative that it seems. In particular, students have had it eat their work in the past and submitting your homework will be more difficult. You’ll probably have to start paying before too long. But it is OK for the first few days as we get you set up for the future.\n\n\n\nSet up your course folders / hard drive\nBe sure to follow along with the setup instructions at the end of the chapter, no matter how far you got in the installataion. DO NOT expect to use Google drive to store your work – it won’t work. We’ve tried.\nYour maij-working folder should be somewhere on your computer or portable drive that you can find it every day. My suggestion is within the “Documents” folder, but you may need to adjust that if you use Dropbox or are using a thumb drive."

Try to digest them as examples of what data means, not the specifics of the stories. They may help you understand how to look at data dictionaries and the importance of granular data.\n\nListen to Rob Gebeloff from the New York Times talk about the difference between granular CDC data on infections and the summary data that was used by most reporters throughout the pandemic in The Daily’s “Counting the Infected” (gift link), The Daily, July 8, 2020.\n(His part is the first 20 minutes or so. Pay particular attention to the part beginning at about 8:00 where he talks about the difference between aggregate and granular data, and what it takes to get the latter.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“‘Very Harmful’ lack of data blunts US response to outbreaks - gift link”, Sharon LaFraniere, New York Times, September 2022. Pay particular attention to the flow chart on how the data is compiled. You will often have to piece together something like this when you start looking for records. The story reminds us not to assume we know what data exists.\n“Thousands allowed to bypass environmental rules in pandemic”, Associated Press, August 2020. This is a great example of looking beyond the news in front of you to collect documents that show a pattern. It shows what can be done in just a couple of months by collecting 50 states’ worth of documents, once you know they should exist.\nWe measured pop music’s falsetto obsession, Vox, August 2019.

(Group 3)\nIf you were to request this dataset from the original source, what other pieces of information would you ask that the government include in the data? Try to imagine what else would be in the data and should be a public record, and ignore things that wouldn’t ever be in it such as information from a court file related to this call.1(Group 4)\n\nRemember that the real world process and the definitions of the data matter.\nFor example, a 911 call doesn’t necessarily mean a crime was committed - it means that the police were dispatched to a specific location. Also, 911 dispatchers don’t ask for someone’s race, ethnicity or DOB when they call – just what is happening and where they are. They don’t even require your name. And there are crimes committed that never have a 911 call – if a police officer sees someone selling drugs, there is no 911 call , just an arrest."
