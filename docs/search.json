In addition, understanding that the national party committee relied on FEC fundraising data to evaluate candidates’ qualification for the program, Santos and Marks allegedly agreed to falsely report to the FEC that Santos had loaned the campaign significant sums of money, including in one instance a $500,000 loan, when, in fact, Santos had not made the reported loans and, at the time the loans were reported, did not have the funds necessary to make such loans."

This reading gets you ready for the lab:\n\nTextbook:\n\nIntroduction to Quick Start\nLearn a New Way to Read\n\n\n\nStory\n\nRural Aid goes to Urban Areas This is a pdf of a very old story from the Washington Post. I use it not because it’s great, but because it is reasonably short and remains one of the most straightforward examples of investigative data reporting that I know of. This is a classic example of using administrative records to find anecdotes and examples for stories, then aggregating them into broader statistical findings. Pay attention to the elements that make this story work – the data sources, examples used, use of experts to define classifications, and the public records mentioned. Make sure to read the methodology notes on the second page.\n\n\n\n\nTry to install R and RStudio\n\nComplete the installation tutorial in the textbook , including the videos linked at the top. You don’t have to answer the questions after the videos.\n\n\nIf you plan to use your own laptop or desktop:\n\nGet as far as you can with the installation\nTry starting up RStudio (not R).\nNote any error messages or other troubles you have so we can fix them in class. Don’t try to Google the resolution on this – the answers might create more problems than they fix. I’ll help you at the end of class.\n\n\n\nIf you are going to use something else:\n\nLabs in school: Make sure you know where you will use the software and have tried starting it. Please let me know if the lab is not set up as you might expect.\nPosit Cloud : Sign up for the service and make sure you know how to access it in class. It’s not the great alternative that it seems. In particular, students have had it eat their work in the past and submitting your homework will be more difficult. You’ll probably have to start paying before too long. But it is OK for the first few days as we get you set up for the future.\n\n\n\n\nSet up your course folders / hard drive\nNo matter how far you got in the installation, be sure to set up your course folder as shown in the video\nDO NOT expect to use Google drive to store your work – it won’t work. We’ve tried. If you use Dropbox, you can set up your course folder within Dropbox instead of within your Documents folder.^ [There are gazillions of tiny files that change every time you make a change in an R project, so you may want to pause syncing while you’re working.]\n\nOn your own computer\nThis video is about 5 minutes, and is shown using a Mac. If you’re on Windows, the idea is the same – create a folder within your Documents folder. The RStudio parts are the same regardless of your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBe sure to open RStudio, not R:\n\n\n\nYour maij-working folder should be somewhere on your computer or portable drive that you can find it every day. My suggestion is within the “Documents” folder, but you may need to adjust that if you use Dropbox or are using a thumb drive."

    "text": "Description\nThis is a class in data journalism focused the systematic use of public records, documents and other material in public affairs reporting. Previous generations might have called it “computer-assisted reporting” or “precision journalism”. Whatever the name, the idea is the same: original reporting and analysis in the service of stories, particularly in the accountability and explanatory genres.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Wormhoudt via Unsplash\n\n\n\nAnalyzing records can help you confirm or disprove a tip, isolate anecdotes, and explore stories or patterns that no one has thought to mention. When you use data-driven techniques, your street reporting will become deeper and more enlightening. Better yet, the techniques you’ll learn in this class will often yield exclusive stories.\nBy the end of this semester, you will be able to:\n\nIdentify how and when analysis of electronic records might strengthen your story, provide important insights, or suggest new lines of reporting.\nApply the R programming language for reporting in efficient, effective and ethical ways that avoid errors.\nIntegrate data journalism techniques with traditional reporting methods.\nWrite effectively with and about data, whether for text or for the ear.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis is a required course for the Masters’ of Arts in Investiative Journalism at Cronkite. It is tightly coordinated with the rest of the curriculum, and depends on your having mastered the work done in Boot Camp in the fall semester. If you have not done this, you’ll need to review on your own:\n\nNumeracy for journalism. There is some self-help material on Canvas if you want to review it.\nSpreadsheet basics: Simple calculations, sorting, filtering and pivot tables. There are videos and exercises in the MAIJ textbook as refreshers. You do not need to have mastered spreadsheets before you start the class, but some material at the end assumes you have knowledge of these techniques.\nEthics in journalism: You should have a basic background on journalistic ethics, at least as practiced in the United States.\n\nThere is NO expectation that you have acquired or used data for your stories in the past, or that you have ever tried to write any computer code in any language."

This site contains or links to all of the reading, viewing, and texts you need. We are using a bespoke online textbook I made that puts together and updates a lot of handouts and tutorials I’ve had scattered around various Canvas sites, Google Drive docs and Github repos.

When possible, use the app rather than the version in your browser. The browser lacks some of the functions that are in the app.\nR and RStudio, both free community versions. You don’t need to install them yet. We’re going to do that together.\n\nAt the end of the semester, we’ll be exploring some of the advanced features of Microsoft Excel and how they differ from Google sheets, but you should feel free to use lab computers for this.\nThere will be other free software that we’ll use for specific projects. I’ll provide links to those as we go along.\n\nRecommended\nBooks you may already have\nThe Art of Access: Strategies for Acquiring Public Records, David Cullier and Charles N.

    "text": "Grading\nThe class uses a point system that initially adds up to 1,000 points for the semester. It’s possible this number of total points may fall if we find there are just too many assignments. If so, I’ll provide an optional assignment during the exam period to make up the difference.\n\n\nDaily work: 400\n\n\n\nClass preparation and labs: 300\n\n\n“What would you do?” posts and discussions : 100\n\n\n\nGraded homework: 150\n\n\nProjects : 450\n\n\nData replication project: 200\n\n\nFinal story memo : 250\n\n\n\nAll work will be submitted and feedback reviewed through Canvas based on the due date shown there in Mountain Standard Time.\n\nDaily work\n400 points\n\nLabs, pre-labs and class preparation\nDoing well in this class means working slowly, methodically and consistently throughout the semester.\nNearly half of your grade is dependent on this slow and steady work.\n\n\n\nMany weeks, there will be one or two low-stakes assignments. Sometimes, I’ll ask you to reflect on what you did and provide feedback. Other times, you will show that you went through a tutorial on your own. It also includes labs that we do in class.\nPrelabs are exercises intended to force you to slow down and go through a tutorial on y our own, reflecting on areas that are muddy or difficult. I’ll use them as diagnostics to decide how to focus our class time. Labs are exercises for you to practice and apply what you’ve learned.\nThese will be submitted in Canvas assignments, but I haven’t yet produced all of them. This means the total points in Canvas won’t be correct until partway through the semester.\n\n\nWhat would you do?\nYou’ve had some background in journalism ethics, but there are specific issues that come up surrounding acquiring, analyzing and presenting data. You will be presented with four scenarios that are based on real-world situations. After reading the material, you will be asked to reflect on some specific questions on a discussion board, which will form the basis of our in-class discussion. Each of these is worth 25 points.\n\n\n\nReplication project\n200 points\nThere are three separate assignments for this project, which challenges you to reproduce some sentences published in real stories using the same data used by the reporters. I’ll provide the stories and the data. Your first job is to identify paragraphs in the story that depended on the dataset that you’ve been given. The second gives you a chance to turn in a draft of your work so that I can help you. The last one is the final version.\n\n\nStory memo\n250 points\nIn this project, you’ll develop a story pitch using a combination of story backgrounding and data analysis. I’ll give you a choice of at least three datasets that I know will work for this assignment. You may propose your own, but it must be easy to obtain, relatively clean, and complicated or large enough that there is something for you to analyze beyond a basic statistic. Generally, the dataset will be of individual records (accidents, inspections, deaths or events), not statistical compilations. You’ll understand this better as we move along.\nThe specific list of datasets may be coordinated with your investigative reporting class, News21 and/or the Howard Center, so they’re subject to change.\nAlthough this is one-quarter of your grade, it’s split among four assignments over more than a month. You’ll build the memo a little at a time, so by the end, it won’t seem like a big lift. I promise.\n\n\nGraded homework\n150 points\nThere will be three smaller graded assignments that are more important than daily work but don’t rise to the level of a project. They are shown in Canvas each with 50 points.\n\n\nGrading policies\n\n50 points or more\n\n\nAny assignment worth 50 points or more will be graded with letters, ranging from E to A+. It follows ASU’s policy on grades. They will not be rounded up.\n\n\nASU’s policy is:\n\n“A” is reserved for “excellent” or “outstanding” work, which goes beyond the explicit requirements in quality, depth, effort, or presentation.\n“B” means “successful”. That means it’s on time, accurate, written or presented in a professional way, and answers the requirements of the assignment.\n“C” is considered “Acceptable” work, in that it has met some, but not all, of the requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder 50 points\nSmaller assignments and labs will be graded as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n115%\nI will award extra points when the work shows extraordinary effort, thought and engagement. You can do everything right, receive an A+ in the course, and never see this. Instead, it’s a way for me to acknowledge unusually ambitious work that goes well beyond the original assignment.\n\n\n100%\nYou have completed all of the work assigned at an acceptable level of quality, and submitted it according to the instructions by the deadline. This might include running code, writing code, providing questions or feedback, or summarizing your results as a journalist. The work shows no fundamental factual errors and reflects an attempt to apply the material at hand. Sometimes, you’ll end up explaining in your homework what you tried to accomplish but couldn’t quite succeed — that’s ok! I hope all of your assignments can acheive this level but understand that it’s not always possible.\n\n\n50%\nYou turned in a late or partial assignment or one that shows cursory review of the material. I hope these will be rare, but I expect most people will have one or two of these throughout the semester.\n\n\n0%\nYou didn’t turn anything in, or what was turned had no meaningful work done."

    "text": "Course requirements\n\n\nShowing up is 80 percent of life.\n\n Woody Allen \n\nThis is an immersion, in-person class and is not offered via Zoom or ASU Sync.\nThe minimal requirement is to arrive on time, prepared, and ready to work. Please refrain from eating, napping, using social media, shopping, or working on something else. I expect you to treat your colleagues with respect and be polite to any guests. (I understand this class is over a lunchtime, but there is no eating allowed in the labs. I’ll be enforcing that.)\nI will insist that devices are closed and turned off for guests, but it’s disprespectful to the entire class when you decide to do something else during discussions or presentations. In addition, research shows that you are much worse at multi-tasking than you think you are, and the class won’t stop because you got distracted or sidetracked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevices in class\n\n\n\nI have a great deal of difficulty concentrating when someone is attending to something else, including researching something, catching up on your homework or using your phone, during class.\nI know this is a character flaw. I will try to overcome it, but if I start losing my place or stumbling over simple questions, I may ask you to leave the classroom or close your computer until you are ready to engage with the material we’re working on.\n\n\nI generally will not monitor messages in Slack or email during or just before class time. The only reliable way to get me a message between 10:20a and 1:20p Mondays and Wednesdays is to do so in person in the classroom.\nIf you need an accommodation, please message me BEFORE 10:20 on the day of class.\n\nAttendance and deadlines\nThere are no excused absences in this course, except for true medical or other emergencies or religious observances. You might decide it’s more important to schedule a job interview, attend a family event, interview a source, or schedule a tight connection on a flight than to attend class or complete your work. If I were you, I might decide the same thing, but these are choices that reflect your priorities. They’re not emergencies, nor are they excused absences or deadlines.\nAs in all journalism work, you are expected to meet deadlines. Late assignments will be heavily penalized and those with small point counts may not be accepted at all.\nPlease advise me the first week of class of any ASU-endorsed absences such as a religious holiday or participation in an ASU team sport that will cause you to miss class so that I can plan accommodations. Here’s what to do if you want an accommodation for an emergency:\n\nIf there is an emergency, such as a car accident or a death in your close circle or family, please let me know as soon as possible and we’ll work out what to do next.\nWe all know there is a lot of flu, COVID and RSV going around this year. If you are sick, you should contact ASU Health Services or your doctor. They can provide the documentation if you are too ill or contagious to leave home.\n\nIn these circumstances, I will work with you to accommodate the absence. That might include extending deadlines and helping you find assistance such as ASU mental health resources and tutoring. I may be able to let you observe (without participating) via Zoom, but you shouldn’t count on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay I be excused?\n\n\n\nThe short answer is “yes” – I don’t take attendance and there is no class participation grade. I get it — sometimes you don’t feel 100% or you have something more important to do or the bus broke down.\nHowever, it will be up to you to keep up or catch up. You will not be offered the opportunity to observe via Zoom. Deadlines will not be extended. You’ll also be excluded from any group assignments that might be part of the class that day.\n\n\nThat said, give yourself a break. There are two no-questions-asked 48-hour extensions on daily work during the semester. This includes labs/prelabs and graded homework. You don’t need to give me a reason – just let me know by 10:20am the day of class, or 6pm the night before the deadline, and I’ll change your deadline. These extensions will not be granted for any part of the two large projects or for the simple “What would you do?” assignments.\n\n\nAccuracy\nIf you pursue reporting with data-driven techniques, you’ll often create original information that no one else can confirm. In fact, your sources are often happy to explain a result you present to them, even if it’s entirely wrong. This puts an even bigger burden on you to understand your sources, to question your assumptions and find holes in your work. If an answer seems too newsworthy2, walk through everything you’ve done step by step. Seek out errors; ask experts or colleagues to challenge your results. We’ll spend a lot of time on practices that will help protect you from errors but your own skepticism (and sometimes even fear) is the best defense.\nI don’t expect your work to be polished and exact. However, work that shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the source, contains a severe miscalculation or misinterpretation, or ignores clear warning signs will receive an E. This is the equivalent of having to retract an entire story because it was based on an obvious error.\nThis requires you to gut-check all of your data work before you turn it in or include it in a sentence. Actually look at your results and decide “could this possibly be true?”\n\n\nHaving trouble?\n\n\n\n\nFabian Moller via Unsplash\n\n\n\nLearning data skills requires a lot of trial and error – a LOT of error. It’s frustrating and maddening at times and you won’t be alone. But there are some strategies that you can use to help get you past roadblocks.\n\nSlow down! Unlike the rest of journalism, going faster doesn’t help. Separate the problem into pieces and solve it one step at a time.\nDon’t get upset over errors. They don’t reflect some kind of flaw in your work – they’re supposed to be helpful. Try to read the error and piece together what’s wrong. A story goes through many drafts before it’s finished, and the same thing will happen with your programs.\nIf you’ve been working on something for more than 20 minutes without making any progress, don’t waste more time on it. If you’re making just a little progress, keep going. But take a break and come back to it if you’re stuck. Get help if you’re really stuck.\nRemember the goal: We’re not trying to become social scientists, computer programmers or data analysts. We’re journalists. Simplify your questions, focusing on newsworthiness rather than academic research.\nPractice. Look for opportunities to hone your skills by applying them outside of class on a personal project or for a story or another course. If you can’t think of any practice, try a #tidytuesday challenge.3"

    "text": "Cronkite school policies\n\nCollaborations\nAll work submitted under your name must be your work and your work alone. When you are assigned work in teams, contributors should be credited when an individual was primarily responsible for a portion of the work. For example, if one student takes the lead on analyzing data and another on writing the results, you should give credit where it is due.\nI will encourage you to work in pairs during some of the labs — it’s much easier to solve problems when two people are looking at the same thing. But you must turn in your work separately and answer question prompts on your own.\n\n\nExtra Credit\nSimple. There is none. Why? This course is made up of a lot of little pieces. They can’t be replaced by attending a lecture.\n\n\nCronkite School Diversity Principles\nThe Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication embraces inclusivity in student, staff and faculty populations in order to create an academic environment that fosters diversity of thought and acceptance of all people regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or societal, political, cultural, economic, spiritual, or physical differences. To this end, the school directs efforts to the following four principles:\n\nActively seek out and encourage diverse populations to become productive members of the faculty, staff and the student body;\nCreate and maintain a work, learning and social environment that is cognizant and supportive of a diversity of human differences and beliefs;\nIncorporate within the formal content of the curriculum and in each course an affirmation of the core journalistic values of accuracy, fairness, ethical behavior and sensitivity when reflecting an increasingly multicultural world;\nFoster and support a climate in which events and activities of the school reflect diversity of awareness, sensitivity to and support for people of different origins, orientations and abilities.\n\n\n\nStudent Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services (SAILS)\nStudent Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services facilitates accommodations for students who have registered with that office. Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case, course-by-course basis through an interactive process with people who can best support student success. Prior to receiving accommodations from their instructor, students must receive verification of eligibility by registering with SAILS. Student SAILS information is confidential.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe school has zero tolerance for academic dishonesty; instructors enforce academic integrity in every course and educational activity offered or sanctioned by the school. Any allegation of academic dishonesty will be referred to an appointed academic integrity officer for investigation. They elevate cases to the school’s standards committee for review and recommendation to the dean of the school. If the committee finds that a student has engaged in academic dishonesty in any form — including but not limited to cheating, plagiarizing, and fabricating — that student shall receive a grade of XE for the class and may face suspension or expulsion from ASU.\nYou must complete the Academic Integrity pledge within the first week of class, included in Canvas as a quiz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrodeur via Unsplash"

    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\nQ: I don’t have any experience. What do I need to succeed?\nEveryone in this class has gone through the boot camp required of all masters students. You covered spreadsheet basics and were expected to have basic numeracy skills such as computing percentages and averages. No other coding or data analysis background is expected.\nQ: This looks like a lot of work. How long do I have to spend on it every week?\nI try to follow the ASU standard for a 3-credit course — approximately 9 hours per week, including class and lab time. That suggests that, on average, you should expect to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week outside of class on preparation, homework and projects.\nIf you’re spending considerably more time on assigned work and preparation, please let me know – that’s not the intention.\nQ: How should I communicate with you? A: Slack\nSlack or in person is best. All assignments must be turned in via Canvas assignments unless I direct you elsewhere. Do NOT email assignments.\nQ: How will I know how I’m doing?\nPay attention to the feedback on your routine homework and labs. I’ll give you a sense of where you’re excelling and where you might improve. I’m always happy to meet and discuss strategies that will help you get to the next level in your journalism or your data analysis skills.\nI’ve found that Canvas isn’t very accurate in estimating the final grade as we work through the semester, so I’ve turned that feature off. It will just mislead you.\nQ: How do I ask good questions?\nIn technical work, asking a good question is an art. Try to:\n\nDescribe what you are trying to do – what does success look like? What question are you trying to answer?\nProvide a snippet of the code or a screenshot of what you are trying. Include any context needed.\nTake a screen shot or quote the error message if there is one\n\nQ: I already know how to code and analyze data. Why do I have to take this class?\nEven if you know how to code, I presume you are at Cronkite because you want to apply all of your skills to a journalism career. You probably knew how to use a phone or take a picture before you came to j-school, but you may not have used them the way you do now. That said, talk with me if you’re concerned that you won’t be challenged enough or want to go further. We’ll find ways to make the time productive and take you to the next level in data reporting.\nQ: Can I use ChatGPT to help me with my coding?\nSure — for help, not for answers. In fact, one of the things it’s really good at is answering the question, “Why doesn’t this code work?” You will have to determine if its answer is right. But for this purpose it’s pretty similar to searching Google and Substack or asking colleague for help.\nYou are responsible for learning the methods taught in the class, not some other way to accomplish the same thing. (You don’t have to memorize anything, but we’re working in very limited version of the world of programming and R, and I won’t go outside it to help you or accept your work.)"

This is my second tour as a Knight chair – the first was at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, from 2009 to 2012.\nI’ve been a reporter and editor for most of my career, starting out as a beat reporter in Florida covering health care, workplace issues and the local economy. That beat led me to hang out a lot in federal bankruptcy and civil courthouses, where many juicy stories seemed to land. I began specializing in data reporting when I found that officials didn’t examine their own data and often had no idea what was in their files.\nFrom there, I went to The Washington Post, where I received most major national investigative journalism awards. They include the Pulitzer Prize in Investigative Reporting, the Robert F. Kennedy award for public service, the Investigative Reporters and Editors medal, and the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting. Before I joined Cronkite I led the data reporting team at The New York Times that focused on investigative and enterprise stories. My team’s members were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize twice in my five years there, and contributed to another Pulitzer.\nI was an elected board member for the 5,000-member Investigative Reporters and Editors for eight years, two of them as president. Currently I serve on the boards of the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting and the [Investigative Post](https://investigativepost.org] in Buffalo.

    "text": "In 2022, The Verge sent a shiver through the spines of professors everywhere with the piece called “File Not Found”, which chronicled the way Zoomers grew up using computers — with search. Historically, anyone who used a computer had to understand how they were organized and how to use folders. But powerful search engines both in the cloud and on your computer made that unnecessary. With that change came a huge roadblock to learning how to code – creating and navigating to a folder became an unfamiliar concept. In fact, the paper folder and file cabinet icons are now meaningless to some students.\nIf you have spent any time working with photo or video editing, you know how important it is to understand where your files are within a folder or directory structure. Programming languages are the same. They have to be explicitly told where to find files, images and resources they need to do their job. All they understand are file names, prefaced by the names of the folders that contain them.\nOn a Mac, everything begins in your “home” directory – the folder that contains all of the things specific to you when you open up the computer. This is often shown as the symbol “~/”. On Windows, it’s usually the “User” folder.\nHere are two introductory videos about folder and files:\n\nWindows\nMacs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-tip for Windows users\n\n\n\nAlthough it may seem that you have to use backslashes to refer to folders or directories in Windows, it understands the forward slash as well. You don’t need to change examples that were written for Macs. It’s also easier to use the forward slash for technical reasons that aren’t worth your time to understand right now. But if you ever start working with regular expressions or programmatic path references, you’ll be happy that this works.\n\n\nKey points:\n\nSet up folders in your documents folder for our class — if everyone puts their work using the same named folders and file names, you’ll always be able to follow along with tutorials and in class. If you choose to go your own way, you won’t be offered any help when you get a dreaded “Not found” or some other error that makes no sense.\nHow to rename files on a Mac and on Windows.

This is a particularly big problem in data journalism, since we often seek out stories in databases based on tips or broad ideas, and can often find them.\nOptional, also by Bradshaw: “A journalist’s guide to cognitive bias (and how to avoid it)” for other kinds of biases that we might bring to our reporting. These include common problems in newsrooms, such as a “sunk-cost” bias or a negativity bias.\nJust the video BBC Worklife, How ‘survivorship bias’ can cause you to make mistakes\n“Fighter pilots and firing coaches”, Brian Burke, 2009, in Advanced Football Analytics, with an explanation of regression to the mean.

It isn’t very well written, but it eventually gets around to an anecdote about fighter pilots and the concept we care about: “regression to the mean”.\nThe videos # 1-4 from the Knight Center for the Americas on “Equity and Ethics in Data Journalism’s” module 3 (links below). I’m not thrilled with the pace or specific content with these videos, but they’re the best single spot I’ve found for these common problems. Feel free to speed this up considerably.

    "text": "Preparation\n\nLearn a new way to read\nToday’s lab is geared at learning how to read and view journalism as a writer and producer, by closely examining HOW a story was conceived and executed rather than whether you liked it or thought it was “good”. This reading gets you ready for the lab:\n\nTextbook:\n\nIntroduction to Quick Start\nLearn a New Way to Read\n\n\n\nStory\n\nRural Aid goes to Urban Areas This is a pdf of a very old story from the Washington Post. I use it not because it’s great, but because it is reasonably short and remains one of the most straightforward examples of investigative data reporting that I know of. This is a classic example of using administrative records to find anecdotes and examples for stories, then aggregating them into broader statistical findings. Pay attention to the elements that make this story work – the data sources, examples used, use of experts to define classifications, and the public records mentioned. Make sure to read the methodology notes on the second page.\n\n\n\n\nTry to install R and RStudio\n\nComplete the installation tutorial in the textbook , including the videos linked at the top. You don’t have to answer the questions after the videos.\n\n\nIf you plan to use your own laptop or desktop:\n\nGet as far as you can with the installation\nTry starting up RStudio (not R).\nNote any error messages or other troubles you have so we can fix them in class. Don’t try to Google the resolution on this – the answers might create more problems than they fix. I’ll help you at the end of class.\n\n\n\nIf you are going to use something else:\n\nLabs in school: Make sure you know where you will use the software and have tried starting it. Please let me know if the lab is not set up as you might expect.\nPosit Cloud : Sign up for the service and make sure you know how to access it in class. It’s not the great alternative that it seems. In particular, students have had it eat their work in the past and submitting your homework will be more difficult. You’ll probably have to start paying before too long. But it is OK for the first few days as we get you set up for the future.\n\n\n\n\nSet up your course folders / hard drive\nNo matter how far you got in the installation, be sure to set up your course folder as shown in the video\nDO NOT expect to use Google drive to store your work – it won’t work. We’ve tried. If you use Dropbox, you can set up your course folder within Dropbox instead of within your Documents folder.^ [There are gazillions of tiny files that change every time you make a change in an R project, so you may want to pause syncing while you’re working.]\n\nOn your own computer\nThis video is about 5 minutes, and is shown using a Mac. If you’re on Windows, the idea is the same – create a folder within your Documents folder. The RStudio parts are the same regardless of your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBe sure to open RStudio, not R:\n\n\n\nYour maij-working folder should be somewhere on your computer or portable drive that you can find it every day. My suggestion is within the “Documents” folder, but you may need to adjust that if you use Dropbox or are using a thumb drive."
