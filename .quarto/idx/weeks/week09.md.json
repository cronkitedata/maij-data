I'll start listing in the agenda links to any presentations or other materials we use in class. \n\n\n### Monday 3/14\n\n\n- [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JV8jIOEKodAc7KNZsr8aFhmv2sKkCHXFeYvVQjcbALE/edit?usp=sharing) on visualization as a reporting tool\n\n- [Knight Center's online course](https://journalismcourses.org/course/data-visualization-for-storytelling-and-discovery/) on visualization from Alberto Cairo \n\n- [Example R Markdown on disasters compiled for reporters in News 21](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/A4-fema-summaries.html). This is just an example of how an analysis can be used with visualizations to help reporting in a team. \n\n- [Example of a one-time use graphic](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/county_delinquency.pdf), with little explanation. I'll explain it in class, and why it was so useful for a total of 10 minutes. This is [another example of a graphic used by reporters for selecting locations](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/reveal_metro_area_master.html) in the PPP story from Reveal. \n\n\n- Textbook chapters: Begins with [Introduction to visualization](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/viz-intro.html) for tips and resources, [Visualization as a reporting tool](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/viz-reporting.html), and [Visualization demo](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/viz-demo.html)\n\nFollowing up from our last session in which I introduced packages used to style numbers, [here is an example markdown](https://rpubs.com/cohensh/833550) that you can use that goes over styling your Markdown documents - it includes examples of using different kinds of templates, formatting numbers, and data preparation in order to make decent-looking tables. There are examples of using `gt` and `reactable` libraries to style numbers. (To download the code, use Chrome. For some reason, Safari doesn't let you do that.) \n\n\n\n### Wednesday 3/16\n\n- Finishing up with visualization\n- Lab for replication project\n\n\n## Upcoming deadlines\n\nSunday 3/20\n{.text-dark}\nFinal replication project\n\nFriday 3/24\n{.text-dark}\nSecond self-assessment\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"week09.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["sandstone","../theme.scss"],"max-width":"1920px","page-layout":"full","toc-location":"left","header-includes":["<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">\n"],"published-title":"Class date","title":"Visualization as a reporting tool","date":"2022-03-14","draft":false,"layout":"single","show_date":true,"weight":15,"description":"Visualizing data is a whole 'nother skill, but we can borrow from the design and statistics world to help make our reporting more efficient.
