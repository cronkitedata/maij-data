Finding and evaluating data on your beat on deadline.  A guide to a data hunt is in the class textbook: [Finding the right data for your story](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-hunt.html), and a template with an old example that won't work anymore is in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14nxUPMIAmIGm1hwWhSBYqoVF3HSlFyk6XWiozXjeO5w/edit) . (These are the same links shared with News21 students earlier this semester.)~~\n\n- We went over the[basics of scraping using this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W4esHT93tKQVUHJLhyVM8f2je-DLWKu-MtzZ7-I6hi8/edit?usp=sharing). We'll continue with scraping using R next week.  I'm going to try to write a scraping exercise in the textbook by next week. \n\n## Upcoming deadlines\n\nSunday 3/20\n{.text-dark}\nFinal replication project\n\nFriday 3/25\n{.text-dark}\nSecond self-assessment\n\nSunday 3/27 \n{.text-dark}\nStory memo proposal\n\n## Preparation & learning materials\n\nIf you want to follow along in class, you can either use the computers in the lab, or install [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/download.html) on your computer -- it doesn't take up much space. Just unzip it and drag it into your applications or anywhere else you want to launch it from. I'm by no means an expert in using this, but it's invaluable for fixing city names and standardizing company names. (Windows folks: Use the \"Windows kit with embedded java\". )\n\nI'll have a chapter in the textbook on it by the time we get to this section. \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"week11.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["sandstone","../theme.scss"],"max-width":"1920px","page-layout":"full","toc-location":"left","header-includes":["<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">\n"],"published-title":"Class date","title":"Data cleaning with Open Refine","date":"2022-03-21","draft":true,"layout":"single","show_date":true,"weight":16,"description":"You've seen it's hard to fix little mistakes in R, and that we don't have a good set of tools to it in Excel.
