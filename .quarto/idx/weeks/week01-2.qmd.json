Read and watch these materials with an eye for the methods they describe -- data collection, counting and analyzing -- and the sources they used. You're not expected to follow links or watch related material unless I mention them. \n\n*Come to class prepared to discuss one passage from one of these pieces that caught your eye.*\n\n* [The Journalistic Method: Five principles for blending analysis and narrative](https://journalistsresource.org/tip-sheets/journalistic-method-tip-sheet-blending-analysis-narrative/), by Nicholas Lemann, former dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\n\n* [Ida B. Wells used data journalism to fight lynching](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/16/8979771/ida-b-wells-lynching-data), Dara Lind, Vox.com, July 2015\n\n* [The Myth of the Machine](https://cronkitedata.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/docs/berens_nerds_words.pdf) Michael J. Berens, a chapter in \"When Nerds and Words Collide\" Poynter Institute, 1999. Although it was written more than 20 years ago, the insights are still relevant today.\n\n* [Introduction to Precision Journalism](https://cronkitedata.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/docs/precision-journalism.pdf), Sage Encyclopedia of Journalism. \n\n### Prepare for Wednesday's lab\n\nThis lab is geared at learning how to read and view journalism as a writer and producer, by closely examining HOW a story was conceived and executed rather than whether you liked it or thought it was \"good\". This is designed to orient you toward the \"reporting\" part of the data reporting equation.\n\n* [Learn a New Way to Read](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-story.html) from our course textbook site. When I assign these chapters, you are not required to study the works listed in the additional reading or exercise sections unless I specifically assign them. \n\n* [Rural Aid goes to Urban Areas](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/rural_development.pdf) This is a pdf of a very old story from the Washington Post. I use it not because it's so great, but because it is *reasonably* short and remains the most straightforward example of investigative data reporting that I know of. Pay attention to the elements that make this story work -- the data sources, examples used, use of experts to define classifications, and the public records mentioned. Be sure to read the \"nerd box\" on the second page. \n<!--\n* \"[The Disproportionate Risk of Driving While Black](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/racial-disparity-traffic-stops-driving-black.html)\", Sharon LaFraniere and Andrew Lehren, The New York Times, October 2015. We'll review this story in a group exercise on Wednesday, so be sure to review it fully. Pay attention to the data sources, the way that they were analyzed, the writing and graphics, and the examples used. If great journalism is what some authors call the selection, not the compression, of facts, then think about how those facts and examples might have been found and why they were selected. After class, I'll provide an annotated version that goes through some of the sources and questions.  \n-->\n\n## Going further\n\n* An academic guide for \"[Reading to Write](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1740-9713.01469)\". This is really for scientists reading academic journals, but we might learn from the techniques.  \n\nUnfortunately, these are not available in the ASU library. \n\n* One really good book for learning to write complicated stories in a variety of ways is William Blundell's \"[Art and Craft of Feature Writing](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/entity/author/B001KDWGWQ)\" . Although it's old, it has some great tips on writing with data. \n\n* Philip Meyer's \"[Precision Journalism](https://www.amazon.com/Precision-Journalism-Reporters-Introduction-Science/dp/0742510883/)\" is a staple on many data journalists' bookshelf. ASU library's version isn't the most recent. \n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"week01-2.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["sandstone","../theme.scss"],"max-width":"1920px","page-layout":"full","toc-location":"left","header-includes":["<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">\n"],"published-title":"Class date","title":"The journalistic method","date":"2022-01-11","draft":false,"description":"Consuming news as a reporter"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
