Do the after-class reading before you tackle this. Get as far as you can in 3-4 hours of dedicated work. This exercise will give me guidance on where to spend our time, so it's more important that you try to do this on your own (with help in #dj-sos or a study hall) than it is that you get the \"right\" answer. In addition, when you're struggling over a piece of it and don't know what to do next, don't just Google. Instead, walk away from the computer and come back in 10 minutes. If you still don't know what to do, put a question on #dj-sos, showing your code and the error or answer you're getting (a screen shot is fine). That way, everyone can learn. You can post anonymously on #dj-sos if you prefer. (Googling will often give you the \"hard\" R version, not the tidyverse \"easy\" R version. It will just confuse you at this stage.)\n\nFriday 2/11\n{.text-dark}\n1st self-assessment\n\nSunday 2/13\n{.text-dark}\nDo the exercises at the end of Chapter 14: [Verbs in Depth: Select, filter, arrange](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-verb-filter.html)  . Some of these are a little tricky - give them a try on your own for a little while before asking for help but please do ask for help if you're stuck.  There is no code for you to copy and paste this time! \n\n\n## Preparation and learning materials\n\n### By Monday class, 2/7\n\nMostly, your work is follow-up from last week. But to get ready for the lessons starting this week, please read the documentation/background on the Paycheck Protection Program data in the [textbook appendix](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/appendix-ppp.html)\n\n### By Wednesday class, 2/9\n\nReview these three very different approaches to reporting on the PPP loans. While you don't need to study them, they're useful to us for several purposes. First, they show how different people attacked the data to find very different stories. In addition, they will provide you some background on the program itself, written for a lay audience. (We like that.) Finally, they're relatively old and I have yet to see good stories now that there is more information - I hope it will spark some ideas. \n\n* [\"Hundreds of PPP Loans Went to Fake Farms in Absurd Places\"](https://www.propublica.org/article/ppp-farms), Derek Willis and Lydia DePillis, ProPublica, May 18, 2021\n* \"[Six Stories From a Downtown District Show Pandemic's Uneven Toll](https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-asheville-businesses-thrived-with-government-backed-ppp-loans-others-struggled-11609426801)\",  Anthony DeBarros and Amara Omeokwe, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 31, 2020.
