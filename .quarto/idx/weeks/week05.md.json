I hope you'll spend some time over the weekend to review what we did in class and in labs. By now you'll have access to DataCamp, and I'll suggest some tutorials there that will help review the material we've gone through. \n\n[Sunday Feb. 19]{.sked-dates} : The sentences you propose replicating for the data replication project\n\n[Monday Feb. 20]{.sked-dates} : What would you do? \n\n## Preparation and learning materials\n\n### Chapters for the labs: \n\n* select and arrange\n* mutate to get new data from old\n\n### Other reading /\n\n* Read the documentation/background on the Paycheck Protection Program data in the [textbook appendix](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/appendix-ppp.html)\n\nReview these three very different approaches to reporting on the PPP loans. While you don't need to study them, they're useful to us for several purposes. First, they show how different people attacked the data to find very different stories. In addition, they will provide you some background on the program itself, written for a lay audience. (We like that.) Finally, they're relatively old and I have yet to see good stories now that there is more information - I hope it will spark some ideas. \n\n* [\"Hundreds of PPP Loans Went to Fake Farms in Absurd Places\"](https://www.propublica.org/article/ppp-farms), Derek Willis and Lydia DePillis, ProPublica, May 18, 2021\n* \"[Six Stories From a Downtown District Show Pandemic's Uneven Toll](https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-asheville-businesses-thrived-with-government-backed-ppp-loans-others-struggled-11609426801)\",  Anthony DeBarros and Amara Omeokwe, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 31, 2020.
