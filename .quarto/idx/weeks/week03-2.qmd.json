It is not strictly necessary to have your own laptop -- all of the software we need is also installed in the lab in Cronkite room 320 and in our classroom.**\n\nConfiguring computers for use in data reporting is one of the most frustrating things that we do. Everyone's computer seems to be set up slightly differently, depending on exactly which version of which operating system you have and when you've last installed various helpers. Don't let yourself get frustrated with this and don't try to Google your way out of it --- it's not worth your mental energy and you might make things worse.  \n\n\n\nIf you had trouble with installation, please use the lab computers for the beginning of class. I'll save time in class so that I can work with you individually to get your computer set up toward the end. \n\n* [Review of file management on computers](../inclass/01-github-logistics.qmd) to stay organized\n* Resolving installation issues \n* Setting up your computer for the rest of the course\n* Installing packages (you'll undestand what this means when the time comes)\n* A review of the screens in R Studio, which can be a little intimidating\n\n\n## Upcoming deadlines\n\n[Sunday Jan. 29]{.sked-dates} : The life of a dataset\n\nBeginning next week, you should expect to have a pre-lab due on Wednesday mornings and a lab on Wednesday in class. The labs are designed to be completed during the class period, but I'll set the deadlines to midnight to accommodate people who can't come to class that day. \n\n## Preparation\n\n **DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN ONE HOUR TRYING TO GET THIS TO WORK.** Instead, note where you had trouble and we'll resolve it in class. Or at least I hope we will. \n\n### Install R and RStudio\n\nR is a programming language, and RStudio is a product made by the company Posit to interact with that language. You have to install the programming language first, then the RStudio interface.\n\nIt's important that you have a very recent version of both R and R Studio, as they both changed dramatically during summer 2022. \n\n**You must have Windows 10 / 11 or Mac Catalina (version 10.15) or newer for this to work.**  All computers made in the last five years -- and [some much earlier](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210222) -- are capable of handling these versions. You may need to update your operating system if you haven't done that in the last three years. Please let me know if you don't know how to do that. The software is also installed on all computers in the classroom and in the lab in Cronkite 320. \n\n* Download and install R version 4.2.2 or higher  for your system from  <https://cloud.r-project.org/> \n    * Most Macbooks:  \"latest package\" \n    * arm64.pkg if you have a very recent M1 Mac  (2021 or newer). You probably know if you have it. \n    * Windows: 64-bit version for Windows 10/11. \n\n* Download and install RStudio  for [Mac](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/macos/RStudio-2022.07.2-576.dmg)  or [Windows](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-2022.07.2-576.exe) )\n\n(You can try going through   [this tutorial on installing R and RStudio](https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/#section-welcome), but it's a little out of date and might be more confusing than it's worth. )\n  \n* Try starting up RStudio (not R). On a Mac, if you get errors that mention \"git\", or \"xcode-select\", just *say yes* and do it. \n\n\n "},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"week03-2.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["sandstone","../theme.scss"],"max-width":"1920px","page-layout":"full","toc-location":"left","header-includes":["<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">\n"],"published-title":"Class date","title":"Install party!","date":"2022-01-22","description":"Logistics for starting your journey into coding"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
