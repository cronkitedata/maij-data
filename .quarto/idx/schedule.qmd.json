Introduce the skills for the current week and introduce the pre-lab. \n* __Wednesday__:  \nReview the questions raised in the pre-lab and do the lab for that week. Pre-lab is due by 10am on the day of class;   \nI'll give you the rest of the day to turn in the labs, but they are designed to be completed during the class period.  \n\nI will often tell you how long I'd like you to spend on an assignment. I hope you'll take these time recommendations seriously -- they reflect the priority you should place on the assignment. For instance, if I say, \"Don't spend more than about an hour on this\", I expect the result to show about one hour's worth of effort and any more effort is wasted. Spending more time will also cut into the time you have available for other work both in this class and elsewhere. But it also means that a cursory glance or 10-minute effort probably isn't enough, depending on how comfortable you are with the material to begin with.\n\nYou do not have to keep track of the assignments on this site -- they are all in Canvas with submission instructions. All of them  exist for a reason. If you don't understand the point of what we're doing, please speak up! Understanding why an assignment is important has a lot to do with how you do it. \n\n## Preliminary schedule\n\nThe schedule is subject to change as we discover where you need or want more time on subjects. Please refer to the Canvas assignments for specifics on class preparation activities and labs. \n\n| Week No. | Dates | Topics | Deadlines  |\n| ------|------|-------------------|--------------- |\n|01|Jan 9-11|Intros; Reading the story; |Su 1/8: Pre-class survey; <br> Fri: Cronkite academic integrity pledge |\n|02|Jan 18|Replication and the data diary; Spreadsheet review|W 1/18: \"What would you do?\" (25) |\n|03|Jan 23-25| The life of data; Getting ready for R, Quarto and Github| Su 1/22: Spreadsheet review (50) |\n|04|Jan 30-Feb 1|R demo: A run-through from start to finish. | Su 1/29: The life of a dataset (50) \n|05|Feb 6-8|Filter and sort| M 2/6: \"What would you do?\" (25)\n|06|Feb 13-15|Group by and mutate|\n|07|Feb 20-22|Join & put it all together| Su 2/19: Replication sentences (50) <br> M 2/20: \"What would you do?\" (25)| \n|08|Feb 27-March 1|Regular expressions | Fri 3/3: Replication update (50)|\n|||Spring break|\n|09|March 13-15|Intro to data viz|\n|10|March 20-22|Scraping | Su 3/19: Replication project (100)| \n|11|March 27-29|Build your own database| Su 3/26: Memo proposal (50) <br> W 3/29 : Building your own database (50)\n|12|April 3-5|Intro to maps and GIS| M 4/3: \"What would you do?\" (25)\n|13|April 10-12|Cleaning data with OpenRefine;  <br> working with pdfs| Su 4/9: First memo update (50)\n|14|April 17-19|Students' choice| Su 4/16: 2nd memo update (75)\n|15|April 24-26|Statistics in the newsroom; curating your github repo for job-hunting; <br> Paying it forward| Su 4/23: Final memo  (100)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"schedule.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["sandstone","theme.scss"],"max-width":"1920px","page-layout":"full","toc-location":"left","header-includes":["<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">\n"],"title":"Preliminary schedule at a glance","date":"12/11/2022","description":"A broad outline of what we'll be doing"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
