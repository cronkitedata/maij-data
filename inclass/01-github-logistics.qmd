## Review: Organizing your computer with folders

Last year, The Verge sent a shiver through the spines of professors everywhere with the piece called "[File Not Found](https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z)", which chronicled the way Zoomers grew up using computers --- with search. Historically, anyone who used a computer had to understand how they were organized and how to use folders. But powerful search engines both in the cloud and on your computer made that unnecessary. With that change came a huge roadblock to learning how to code -- creating and navigating to a folder became an unfamiliar concept. 

Computer programs are dumb. They don't have search -- all they see are file names, prefaced by the names of the folders that contain them. 

On a Mac, everything begins in your "home" directory -- the folder that contains all of the things specific to you when you open up the computer.  When we use R, RStudio and Github, it will become crucial that you understand how the computer sees your files, and how you can find them yourself. 

Here are two introductory videos about folder and files:

Key points: 

* Set up folders in your documents folder for our class --- if we put everything in the same place called the same thing, you'll always be able to follow along with tutorials and in class. 
* How to rename files  [on a Mac](https://themacbeginner.com/rename-files-and-folders-in-mac-osx/) and on [Windows](https://www.teachucomp.com/how-to-rename-files-and-folders-in-windows-11-instructions/). This will be useful when you download. 
* Moving vs. copying files across folders
* Backing up your work
* Style guide for naming conventions: "[How to Name Files](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files?)" from Jenny Bryant

## Setting up the Github repository for this class - OPTIONAL 

If you want to get ahead in data journalism, you'll be expected to have presence on the code sharing site called Github. Each project in Github is called a `repository` or `repo`. You have the option of submitting your coding assignments through Github insteaed of Canvas. Here are the basics of setting it up, but I'll hold an optional Zoom lab walking through these steps if enough people are interested. 

1. Create an account on https://github.com/join . Be sure to use a username that you won't mind employers seeing -- it's kind of hard to change it later. 
2. Create a new "repo", or repository, for this class. You might call it "mco510"
3. Download and install the Github desktop app for your operating system. 
4. Open the app, and use your credentials to get to your account. 
5. In the File menu, "clone" your mco510 repo

Now, any document you put in that folder on your computer can be "pushed" to the online repo.   

You may keep your repos private, but be sure to add me as a collaborator: sarah.h.cohen@asu.edu
