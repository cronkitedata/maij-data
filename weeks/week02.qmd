## Preparation and learning materials

### Reading 
[Estimated time: less than an hour]{.small-text}

* [Documenting your work](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-data-document.html) from the textbook

### Get to know R and RStudio

This prep might leave you feeling bewildered. Don't let it get to you. You will get used to the look and feel of the software and some of the technical language soon. You don't have to internalize all of this. Instead, try to get used to the screen and the process of typing the commands into the computer. You'll probably get a lot of errors, and that's fine --- they're not judging you. They're supposed to be hints, even when they're [red]{.text-danger} and use words that look like *$#u893q#r32*.

::: {.callout-note}
I usually list the readings in a suggested order. They often build on one another.
:::

1.  Follow along in the textbook chapter, "[Getting started with R and RStudio](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/quickstart-startup.html)". This means, "Open RStudio yourself and compare your screens and your commands to the ones in the book." Don't just skim this. Take notes and be prepared to go over any points of confusion in class. 

  Be sure to: 

  * Install the packages at the end of the chapter. Depending on how you installed R and RStudio, this could be slow and appear that it's stopped working. Just go get some coffee and come back in a little while. 

  * Watch the [Andrew Heiss](https://youtu.be/cnQ-v1UUWyE?si=zBRWU1R53yml1jJ0) video shown in the textbook. Ignore how math-centric it is, and just concentrate on his explanation of the screens.

2. **Optional** Try the [`swirl` tutorial](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/quickstart-startup.html#optional-hands-on-tutorial) mentioned in the textbook.

## Follow-up materials

* [Creating Quarto documents](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/quickstart-quarto.html)

* [22-minute video](https://youtu.be/FlX75wfL9ew) that goes through what we will go through in class
