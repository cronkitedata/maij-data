<!-- You don't have anything due this week, so I strongly suggest you review the work we did last week until you're comfortable with it. Here are a few practice datasets that you can use to start honing your ability to ask questions and use code to get close to the answers,-->

## Agenda

### Monday

* Review of the labs we did last week, and questions that came up during that. 
* Introducing the verbs for this week: Group by and summarize.


### Wednesday

* Review the pre-lab
* Lab on group by, summarize. 

## Upcoming deadlines

[Sunday 2/20]{.sked-dates} Your proposal for the [replication project](../projects/replication.qmd).


Friday 3/4 
{.text-dark}
Update on the replication project. 


## Preparation and learning materials 

We'll be walking through chapters in the textbook this week, and you don't have anything else.  Instead, spend some time looking at the story choices for the replication project so you make a smart choice and study the sentences to come up with the ones you want to replicate.
