<!-- You don't have anything due this week, so I strongly suggest you review the work we did last week until you're comfortable with it. Here are a few practice datasets that you can use to start honing your ability to ask questions and use code to get close to the answers,-->

## Agenda



## Upcoming deadlines

[Sunday 2/19]{.sked-dates} Your proposal for the [replication project](../projects/replication.qmd)

[Monday 2/20]{.sked-dates} *What would you do?* Assigning characteristics based on Census data.

::: {.callout-note}
I understand that some of you will before March 3 for your Borderlands trip. I will not accept requests for extensions on this assignment because of it -- there is plenty of time to turn it in early, before you go.

## Preparation and learning materials 

We'll be walking through chapters in the textbook this week, and you don't have anything else.  Instead, spend some time looking at the story choices for the replication project so you make a smart choice and study the sentences to come up with the ones you want to replicate.
