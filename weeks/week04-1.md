--- 

For the next couple of weeks, it may seem that we've left the world of reporting and investigative journalism. Most of your work and reading is focused on a getting you started in a programming language without interruption. 

Generally, each day will go sort of like this: 

* We'll go over the work from the previous class, and probably have a lab.
* I'll introduce the new material in a demo, which you can follow along with (or not)
* You'll then do after-class reading, which will make more sense once you've seen it in action. 
* Then you'll do the homework, which will depend on you having been in class and done the after-class reading.

This week is a little bit of a rest while I get you oriented to the R environment and help you get set up to move forward. 

I'll try to keep it relevant.

## Agenda

* Install party! - please bring your laptop if you plan to use it for this course.
