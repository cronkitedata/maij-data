description: This is an outline and resource page for our mapping sessions. I'm making it instead of a textbook chapter because our textbook format is a little difficult for this. It will contain links to examples.

## Resources

Mapping is done through Geographic Information Systems, or GIS. We can use any number of apps to do basic mapping: Google Maps, Google Earth, QGIS, ArcMap (or ESRI maps), or even R. For us, we'll start with QGIS, as it's free, available for any operating system, and mimics the ArcMap products that governments use. 

Allie Kanik from the Houston Chronicle has written several excellent introductions to both mapping and QGIS, which we'll follow in class: 

* [Introduction to Spatial Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQa1SoCTSXt4M-NC93U93vScXxn79sWzqJsDVKmqtPQ/edit#heading=h.b56ghjle2ufi)
* [Introduction to QGIS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IuPyht3HhYzQNggURBXedp4O4jF6f_lyRoZV10sKrus/edit)
* [QGIS and Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LCjMGMst95GeBnMx-dmVQ66-XiaCB3uz6NrZzluYNMk/edit)

Another good source is the self-guided GIS course from Francis (Frank) Donnelly, a Brown University professor who runs the blog "[At the Coordinates](https://atcoordinates.info/)", and has written some self-guided tutorialis for QGIS linked from that site, along with a [great set of FAQ's](https://library.brown.edu/create/gis/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2021/08/qgis_faqs.pdf) for QGIS.  

## Using QGIS

You can download and install QGIS for free, but there is a warning: The installation can be a bit tricky, and it will be much harder on your computer than anything else we've done in class. Geographic systems are resource-intensive because there's so much math involved in it and in its visualization. You may find it more efficient to just use the computers in class for this. Later on, I'll show you how to do much of what you do in QGIS in R.

## Starting out

For now, I'm working off of this presentation in Google. I'll transfer it over later on this week.
