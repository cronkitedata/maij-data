## Agenda


## Preparation

### Prep work to get  you ready for class

* We'll be looking at maps that have Census data in them, which means you need to [sign up for a free API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). You can use any email address that you have access to, and enter "None" in organization if you're concerned about privacy. This looks bogus, but it's actually [linked off of the Census Developer documentation]

* Install five packages: `tidycensus`, `tigris`, `sf` , `tmap` and `leaflet`. We may not use them all, but they'll be ready if we need them.
