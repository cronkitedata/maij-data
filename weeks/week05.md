description: This week we'll get back to working with journalism-related data, and start going deeper into some of the key verbs that you'll use throughout your R journey. 
--- 

This marks the beginning of collapsing each week's work into one page on this website. 

This week, we'll go over some details of how to use the most common five verbs: `select`, `arrange`, `mutate`, `summarise`, `group_by`, and `filter` using a data source more likely to yield interesting stories: The Paycheck Protection Program loans for businesses and projects in Arizona. 

EDIT: I changed the details of what we're doing on Wednesday, when we'll look closer at the `filter` verb and get an introduction to filtering without an exact match. 


## Agenda

### Monday 

* Review the Hot 100 exercise from homework. 
* Introduce the Paycheck Protection Program data that we'll use for the next several weeks. 
* Together, review the first set of verbs of the Tidyverse (likely `select`, `arrange`, `mutate`) and their functions. 

### Wednesday

* ~~Dig deeper into `group_by` and `summarise`~~
* Dig deeper into `filter` 
* ~~Learn to format numbers so they are readable.~~


## Upcoming deadlines

Sunday 2/6
{.text-dark}
* Billboard Top 100 introductory tutorial. Do the after-class reading before you tackle this. Get as far as you can in 3-4 hours of dedicated work. This exercise will give me guidance on where to spend our time, so it's more important that you try to do this on your own (with help in #dj-sos or a study hall) than it is that you get the "right" answer. In addition, when you're struggling over a piece of it and don't know what to do next, don't just Google. Instead, walk away from the computer and come back in 10 minutes. If you still don't know what to do, put a question on #dj-sos, showing your code and the error or answer you're getting (a screen shot is fine). That way, everyone can learn. You can post anonymously on #dj-sos if you prefer. (Googling will often give you the "hard" R version, not the tidyverse "easy" R version. It will just confuse you at this stage.)

Friday 2/11
{.text-dark}
1st self-assessment

Sunday 2/13
{.text-dark}
Do the exercises at the end of Chapter 14: [Verbs in Depth: Select, filter, arrange](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-verb-filter.html)  . Some of these are a little tricky - give them a try on your own for a little while before asking for help but please do ask for help if you're stuck.  There is no code for you to copy and paste this time! 


## Preparation and learning materials

### By Monday class, 2/7

Mostly, your work is follow-up from last week. But to get ready for the lessons starting this week, please read the documentation/background on the Paycheck Protection Program data in the [textbook appendix](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/appendix-ppp.html)

### By Wednesday class, 2/9

Review these three very different approaches to reporting on the PPP loans. While you don't need to study them, they're useful to us for several purposes. First, they show how different people attacked the data to find very different stories. In addition, they will provide you some background on the program itself, written for a lay audience. (We like that.) Finally, they're relatively old and I have yet to see good stories now that there is more information - I hope it will spark some ideas.
