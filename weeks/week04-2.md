## Agenda

* Create your first markdown document
* An introduction to (some of) the verbs of the Tidyverse using Billboard top 100 hits.


## Upcoming deadlines

Wednesday 2/2
{.text-dark}
* Markdown lab

Sunday 2/6
{.text-dark}
* Billboard Top 100 introductory tutorial. Do the after-class reading before you tackle this. Get as far as you can in 3-4 hours of dedicated work. This exercise will give me guidance on where to spend our time, so it's more important that you try to do this on your own than it is that you get the "right" answer. Try to avoid the temptation to Google or copy/paste your way out of a problem. Getting god answers from Google is hard, and copy/paste doesn't helpyou understand. Instead, check for typos and try to read the error message. Back up and run one line at a time to see what's happening. But don't struggle for too long -- post anonymously if you'd like on #dj-sos. 


Friday 2/11

1st self-assessment


## Preparation & learning materials

### For today 

* [A gentle introduction to programming](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/appendix-program.html). Think about how you'd make an algorithm for a routine daily chore. You don't have to turn anything in, but we'll discuss in class. 
* Review [Getting Started with R And RStudio](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-start.html). We will have covered this chapter in class on Monday, but it's worth taking another look. If you haven't already, please create the master folder on your computer and set up your project. 
* Read [R Markdown](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-markdown.html). We will create that document in class today, but please read it so you are oriented to what we'll be doing . 


### After class learning materials

- [Getting and saving data](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-data-import.html) 
- [A quick tour of verbs](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-verbs.html)
