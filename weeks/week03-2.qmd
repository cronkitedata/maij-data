date:   2024-01-24
draft: true
description:  You can do an awful lot in R just by mastering seven verbs. We'll go through six of them in a quick tour.

Pre-labs are due by 9:30am on the day of class unless otherwise noted. Labs are due after our in-class lab unless otherwise noted. The deadlines are correct in Canvas.^[I often set the lab deadlines to midnight for those who can't come to class, but I don't want you doing work on them after class. You have more important things to do!]

* [Wednesday Jan. 24]{.sked-dates} : Verbs lab
* [Monday Jan. 29]{.sked-dates} : 
    * Filter and sort prelab and lab
    * What would you do? 
* [Wed Jan 31]{.sked-dates} : Mutate prelab and lab 



## Preparation: 

* Read the TK chapter in the textbook on granularity of data and where it comes from. You do not need to watch the video from Duke University.

* Listen to Rob Gebeloff from the New York Times talk about the difference between granular CDC data on infections and the summary data that was used by most reporters throughout the pandemic in The Daily's "[Counting the Infected](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-data-united-states.html)"  The Daily, July 8, 2020. (His part is the first 20 minutes or so. Pay particular attention to the part beginning at about 8:00 where he talks about the difference between aggregate and granular data, and what it takes to get the latter.)

Pay particular attention to the diagram showing how the systems interact. The story reminds us not to assume we know what data exists.
