**Please bring your laptop to school if you plan to use it for the rest of the semester. If you prefer to use school labs, the software is installed in Cronkite 320 and in our classroom. But if you want to use your own laptop or home computer, you must get it set up properly this week.**

Configuring computers for use in data reporting is one of the most frustrating things that we do. Everyone's computer seems to be set up slightly differently, depending on exactly which version of which operating system you have and when you've last installed various helpers. Don't let yourself get frustrated with this and don't try to Google your way out of it --- it's not worth your mental energy and you might make things worse.  


## Agenda

If you had trouble with installation, please use the lab computers for the beginning of class. I'll save time in class so that I can work with you individually to get your computer set up toward the end. 

* Review of file management on computers to stay organized
* Setting up your computer for the rest of the course
* Installing packages (you'll undestand what this means when the time comes)
* A review of the screens in R Studio, which can be a little intimidating
* Resolving installation issues 


## Upcoming deadlines

[Friday Jan. 27]{.sked-dates}: Complete the R Installation assignment in Canvas. Note the Friday due date -- We will have to resolve any lingering problems in accessing the software over the weekend. 

[Sunday Jan. 29]{.sked-dates} : The life of a dataset

## Preparation  

I believe most of you will want to work at home, not Cronkite computers, most of the time. There is an assignment due on Friday that tells me how you plan to work for the rest of the course -- on your own desktop or laptop or some other way. 

### Install R and RStudio

Try to follow along with  [Installing R and RStudio](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-install.html)

#### Using your own computer

 **DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN ONE HOUR TRYING TO GET THIS TO WORK.** Instead, note where you had trouble and we'll resolve it in class. Or at least I hope we will. 

 
* Get as far as you can with the installation
* Try starting up RStudio (not R). 
* Note any error messages or other troubles you have so we can fix them in class. 

#### Using something else

* Make sure you know where you will use the software and have tried starting it. Please let me know if the lab is not set up as you might expect. 
* If you plan to use Posit  Cloud, please see me -- this will make your submissions more complicated, it doesn't work very well for some of what we do, and may end up costing you some money. You'll need to let me know in advance if you plan to use it so I can show you how to adapt the instructions you'll see for the rest of the semester. 


### Set up your course folders / hard drive 

**No matter how far you got in the installation, be sure to set up your course folder as shown in the video**

#### On your own computer

#### If you're using something else

* Create a folder on your portable hard drive or thumb drive called `maij-working` 
* DO NOT expect to use Google drive to store your work -- it won't work. You will not be able to directly access the data in the Google drive on your computer, and there are strict limits on the size of the data file you can transfer using it. Believe me. We've tried.

If you use Dropbox, you can set up your course folder within the Dropbox instead of within your Documents folder.
