## Agenda

* Finish anything that we couldn't get to on Monday
* Do the lab on verbs in class

## Upcoming deadlines 

Pre-labs are due by 10am the day of class unless otherwise noted. Labs are due after our in-class lab unless otherwise noted. You will have a lab, prelab, or both nearly every day so they won't be listed here anymore.

* [Monday Jan. 29]{.sked-dates} : What would you do? 

## Preparation: 

* [A quick tour of verbs](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/quickstart-verbs.html). We'll do the prelab in class, but come to class ready to ask questions about the chapter.
