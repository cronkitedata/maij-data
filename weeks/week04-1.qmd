For the next few of weeks, it may seem that we've left the world of reporting and investigative journalism. Most of your work and reading is focused on a getting you started in a programming language without interruption. 

Generally, the weeks will go like this: 

**Mondays**: We'll go over any reading and homework from the weekend and address common areas of confusion. Then I'll introduce the week's skills and the pre-lab assignment, which will be due before class on Wednesday. (Prelabs are really walkthroughs of the reading, where you follow along on your own computer. They're designed to take about an hour.) 

**Wednesdays**: We
We'll go through the lab in class where you can get help. The labs will be due at the end of class. It's important not to spend more time on it because I'll use these to diagnose areas of confusion. 

Weekends are used to work on projects and remind us that we are in a journalism program.
