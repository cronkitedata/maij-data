For the next month or more, our weeks will generally look like this: 

**Mondays**: We'll go over any reading and homework from the weekend and address common areas of confusion. Then I'll introduce the week's skills and the pre-lab assignment, which will be due before class on Wednesday. (Prelabs are really walkthroughs of the reading, where you follow along on your own computer. They're designed to take about an hour.) 

**Wednesdays**: We
We'll go through the lab in class where you can get help. The labs will be due at the end of class. It's important that we not spend more time on them, since I'll be using the results to diagnose where we need to do more work. If you spend too much time, I won't know that it's not clear. 

Weekends are used to work on projects and remind us that we are in a journalism program.
