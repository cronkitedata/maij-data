## Agenda

NOTE: We may move everything back a day or two to give you a breather after the replication project. It doesn't affect your final project. We'll discuss on Monday.

### Monday 3/20

* Sometimes the best visualization is just a really useful table, either static or interactive. We'll look at a few packages and details on creating them, using our PPP data as an example.


* Principles of visualization as a reporting tool 

   - [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JV8jIOEKodAc7KNZsr8aFhmv2sKkCHXFeYvVQjcbALE/edit?usp=sharing) on visualization as a reporting tool

   - [Knight Center's online course](https://journalismcourses.org/course/data-visualization-for-storytelling-and-discovery/) on visualization from Alberto Cairo 

   - [Example R Markdown on disasters compiled for reporters in News 21](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/A4-fema-summaries.html). This is just an example of how an analysis can be used with visualizations to help reporting in a team. 

   - [Example of a one-time use graphic](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/reveal_metro_area_master.html) in the PPP story from Reveal, used to select locations for further reporting. 


### Wednesday 3/22

- Finishing up with visualization




Following up from our last session in which I introduced packages used to style numbers, [here is an example markdown](https://rpubs.com/cohensh/833550) that you can use that goes over styling your Markdown documents - it includes examples of using different kinds of templates, formatting numbers, and data preparation in order to make decent-looking tables. There are examples of using `gt` and `reactable` libraries to style numbers. (To download the code, use Chrome. For some reason, Safari doesn't let you do that.) 


## Upcoming deadlines

[Sunday 4/9]{.sked-dates}: First memo update



## Textbook chapters

We'll base some of our work on these chapters, but you are not responsible for reading them before class. Instead, we'll walk through together.
