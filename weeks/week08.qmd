## Preparation

### For Wednesday

- "[Newsroom math](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-math.html)"

- “[How to prevent confirmation bias affecting your journalism](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2020/04/07/how-to-prevent-confirmation-bias-affecting-your-journalism/)” Paul Bradshaw, Online Journalism Blog. This is a particularly big problem in data journalism, since we often seek out stories in databases based on tips or broad ideas, and can often find them. 

- **Optional**, also by Bradshaw: “[A journalist’s guide to cognitive bias (and how to avoid it)](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2020/03/24/a-journalists-guide-to-cognitive-bias-and-how-to-avoid-it/)” for other kinds of biases that we might bring to our reporting. These include common problems in newsrooms, such as a “sunk-cost” bias or a negativity bias.

- Just the video [BBC Worklife, How ‘survivorship bias’ can cause you to make mistakes](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200827-how-survivorship-bias-can-cause-you-to-make-mistakes)  

- “[Fighter pilots and firing coaches](https://faculty.mccombs.utexas.edu/carlos.carvalho/teaching/regression_to_the_mean.pdf)”, Brian Burke, 2009, in Advanced Football Analytics, with an explanation of regression to the mean. (This link is to a printout of the original piece, since the website version is a little bit of a mess.) It isn’t very well written, but it eventually gets around to an anecdote about fighter pilots and the concept we care about: “regression to the mean”.


- The videos # 1-4 from the Knight Center for the Americas on “Equity and Ethics in Data Journalism’s” module 3 (links below). I’m not thrilled with the pace or specific content with these videos, but they’re the best single spot I’ve found for these common problems. **Feel free to speed this up considerably.** I found that 1.75 was the right speed for me! (She talks about writing data journalism stories, but she’s never been a journalist of any kind. Sigh.)
