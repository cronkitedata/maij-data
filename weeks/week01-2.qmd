## Agenda

You have a lot of little things to do to get ready for today's class. Make sure not to spend more than 1 hour getting R and RStudio installed. 

* Reading the data-driven story
* A gentle introduction to programming
* Resolving installation issues

**Please bring your laptop to school if you plan to use it for your homework and projects.**

Configuring computers for use in data reporting is one of the most frustrating things that we do. Everyone's computer seems to be set up slightly differently, depending on exactly which version of which operating system you have and when you've last installed various helpers. 

Don't get frustrated and **don't try to Google your way out of it** --- it's not worth your mental energy and you might make things worse. Just stop and bring your laptop to class, where we can troubleshoot together. 


## Upcoming deadlines

[Friday]{.sked-dates} :

 * Complete the R and RStudio installation assignment in Canvas. I hope we'll take care of any issues during class, but this gives us a couple of days to work out any kinks before you need it. You will need to use the programs before our next class.
 * Cronkite Academic Integrity pledge

[Wednesday, Jan. 17]{.sked-dates} : 

  * What would you do? Reporting live election results. Note the 9:30am deadline. 
  * In-class lab

## Preparation and learning materials

### Learn a new way to read

Today's lab is geared at learning how to read and view journalism as a writer and producer, by closely examining HOW a story was conceived and executed rather than whether you liked it or thought it was "good". This reading gets you ready for the lab: 

* [Learn a New Way to Read](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-story.html) from our course textbook site. You don't need to do the exercises.

* [Defining data](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-data.html) from the course textbook. We'll come back to this later in the semester after you have some practice looking at data, but it's useful to get familiar with the ideas now.

* [Rural Aid goes to Urban Areas](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/rural_development.pdf) This is a pdf of a very old story from the Washington Post. I use it not because it's so great, but because it is *reasonably* short and remains one of the most straightforward examples of investigative data reporting that I know of. This is a classic example of using administrative records to find anecdotes and examples for stories, then aggregating them into broader findings. Pay attention to the elements that make this story work -- the data sources, examples used, use of experts to define classifications, and the public records mentioned. Make sure to read the methodology notes on the second page.

### Install R and RStudio

#### If you plan to use your own laptop:

Try to follow along with  [Installing R and RStudio](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-install.html) .  For most of you, this will be straightforward if you follow the instructions, and will take less than 15 minutes. But there is always a chance that there are problems. **DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN ONE HOUR TRYING TO GET THIS TO WORK.**. 


* Get as far as you can with the installation
* Try starting up RStudio (not R). 
* Note any error messages or other troubles you have so we can fix them in class. Don't try to Google the resolution on this -- the answers might create more problems than they fix. I'll help you at the end of class. 

#### If you are going to use something else: 

* In school: Make sure you know where you will use the software and have tried starting it. Please let me know if the lab is not set up as you might expect. 

* Posit  Cloud : Sign up for the service and make sure you know how to access it in class. It's not the great alternative that it seems. In particular, students have had it eat their work in the past and submitting your homework will be more difficult. You'll probably have to start paying before too long. But it is OK for the first few days as we get you set up for the future.

### Set up your course folders / hard drive 

**No matter how far you got in the installation, be sure to set up your course folder as shown in the video**

DO NOT expect to use Google drive to store your work -- it won't work. You will not be able to directly access the data in the Google drive on your computer, and there are strict limits on the size of the data file you can transfer using it. Believe me. We've tried. If you use Dropbox, you can set up your course folder within Dropbox instead of within your Documents folder. 

#### On your own computer

This video is about 5 minutes, and is shown using a Mac. If you're on Windows, the idea is the same -- create a folder within your Documents folder. The RStudio parts are the same regardless of your operating system.

#### If you're using something else

* Create a folder on your portable hard drive or thumb drive called `maij-working` 

**When you're done, follow the directions in the Canvas assignment called Prelab 0: Install R and RStudio.**

## Follow up materials

When we do something in class that you didn't have to do beforehand, I'll often list some links here to remind you of what we did, or to clarify areas that might have been confusing.
