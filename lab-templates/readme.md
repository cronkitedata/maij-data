This is the folder that contains shells for pre-lab homework. 

When you want to work on a prelab, click on the name of the lab, then either download the RAW version to your computer, or copy it. Note that on some computers, when you save the raw version, it will convert the extension (the last three letters after a period) to ".txt". You need to erase that part of the name.
