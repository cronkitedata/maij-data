## Schedule and assignment logistics

For most of the semester, we'll spend our week this way: 

* __Monday__:  
Discuss the preparation or assignment you did over the weekend. Introduce the skills for the current week and introduce the pre-lab. 
* __Wednesday__:  
Review the questions raised in the pre-lab and do the lab for that week. Pre-lab is due by 10am on the day of class;   
I'll give you the rest of the day to turn in the labs, but they are designed to be completed during the class period.  

I will often tell you how long I'd like you to spend on an assignment. I hope you'll take these time recommendations seriously -- they reflect the priority you should place on the assignment. For instance, if I say, "Don't spend more than about an hour on this", I expect the result to show about one hour's worth of effort and any more effort is wasted. Spending more time will also cut into the time you have available for other work both in this class and elsewhere. But it also means that a cursory glance or 10-minute effort probably isn't enough, depending on how comfortable you are with the material to begin with.

You do not have to keep track of the assignments on this site -- they are all in Canvas with submission instructions. All of them  exist for a reason. If you don't understand the point of what we're doing, please speak up! Understanding why an assignment is important has a lot to do with how you do it. 

## Preliminary schedule

The schedule is subject to change as we discover where you need or want more time on subjects. Please refer to the Canvas assignments for specifics on class preparation activities and labs. 

**NOTE:** The "build your own database" assignment may be moved to early February to accommodate the News21 project. It'll be way more interesting if this works out, so I don't think you'll mind.
