## Schedule and assignment logistics

This is a preliminary schedule that will probably change as we move along. You may want to spend more or less time on a topic, or we might have some guest speakers. I'll try to keep this updated as we go along.

The due dates listed here are only for scheduled assigments. Expect to have a lab and / or a prelab due nearly every day.
