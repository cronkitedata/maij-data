You have a few things to do to get ready for the first class. 

* Complete the Skills and Interests survey  (link is in Canvas assignment so it's not public)
* Familiarize yourself with the structure of this site. It's one you'll use every day.^[There's a reason for this: It means we don't have to sign into Canvas every time we want to do anything.] 
* Review the Syllabus and Schedule here (or in Canvas - it's the same thing)
* Complete the pre-class Slack assignment. This will be our primary method of communicating, so it's crucial that this is set up properly for you to get notifications and be able to ask questions.
