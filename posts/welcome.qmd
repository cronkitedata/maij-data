Most of the links you need for class will be on both this site AND Canvas, but I'll put ASU-only links in Canvas without linking here. If there's ever a conflict, Canvas wins. 

You have a few things to do to get ready for the first class. 

* Complete the Skills and Interests survey  (link is in Canvas assignment so it's not public)
* Complete the pre-class Slack assignment. This will be our primary method of communicating, so it's crucial that this is set up properly for you to get notifications and be able to ask questions. 
* Review the [Syllabus](../syllabus.qmd)  
* Complete the "Preparation" for [the first day](../weeks/week01-1.qmd)

## If you plan to use your laptop

By Wednesday, you need to make sure your operating system (Mac or Windows) is reasonably up to date. For Macs, you must have Mac Big Sur (v11, released in 2020) or newer installed; for Windows, you must have Windows 10 or 11. Please let me know if you need help with this. It doesn't matter if it's the latest version of the operating system.

Tablets and Chromebooks are not adquate replacements for a computer in this class, but you don't need your own computer to take this class. All of the software you need is installed in our classroom, the lab in Cronkite 320, and the labs at ASU, including UCENT.
