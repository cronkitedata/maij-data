Most of the links you need for class will be on both this site AND Canvas, but I'll put ASU-only links in Canvas without linking here. If there's ever a conflict, Canvas wins. 

You have a few things to do to get ready for the first class. 

* Complete the Skills and Interests survey  (link is in Canvas assignment so it's not public)
* Complete the pre-class Slack assignment. This will be our primary method of communicating, so it's crucial that this is set up properly for you to get notifications and be able to ask questions. 
* Review the [Syllabus](../syllabus.qmd)  
* Complete the "Preparation" for [the first day](../weeks/week01-1.qmd)

## If you plan to use your laptop

By Wednesday, you need to make sure your operating system (Mac or Windows) is reasonably up to date. For Macs, you must have Mac Catalina (10.15) or newer installed; for Windows, you must have Windows 10 or 11. Any Mac purchased after 2019 already has an adequate operating system but older ones may need to be updated. Please let me know if you need help with this. It doesn't matter if it's the latest version of the operating system.

Tablets and Chromebooks are not adquate replacements for a computer in this class. The software just won't work on them, and I can't help you if you try to work around it. All of the software we need is installed in the classroom and in the lab in Cronkite 320. (I hope.)
